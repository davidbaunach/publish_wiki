Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 1</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Introduction</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I owe my interest in public education to Everett Reimer. Until we first met in Puerto Rico<br>
in 1958, 1 had never questioned the value of extending obligatory schooling to all people.<br>
Together we have come to realize that for most men the right to learn is curtailed by the<br>
obligation to attend school. The essays given at CIDOC and gathered in this book grew<br>
out of memoranda which I submitted to him, and which we discussed during 1970, the<br>
thirteenth year of our dialogue. The last chapter contains my afterthoughts on a<br>
conversation with Erich Fromm on Bachofen's Mutterrecht.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Since 1967 Reimer and I have met regularly at the Center for Intercultural<br>
Documentation (CIDOC) in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Valentine Borremans, the director of<br>
the Center, also joined our dialogue, and constantly urged me to test our thinking against<br>
the realities of Latin America and Africa. This book reflects her conviction that the ethos,<br>
not just the institutions, of society ought to be "deschooled."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it<br>
were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools.<br>
Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational<br>
hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the<br>
pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal<br>
education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the<br>
search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for<br>
each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring.<br>
We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research<br>
on education— and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service<br>
industries.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">On Wednesday mornings, during the spring and summer of 1970, 1 submitted the various<br>
parts of this book to the participants in our CIDOC programs in Cuernavaca. Dozens of<br>
them made suggestions or provided criticisms. Many will recognize their ideas in these<br>
pages, especially Paulo Freire, Peter Berger, and JosZ Maria Bulnes, as well as Joseph<br>
Fitzpatrick, John Holt, Angel Quintero, Layman Allen, Fred Goodman, Gerhard Ladner,<br>
Didier Piveteau, Joel Spring, Augusto Salazar Bondy, and Dennis Sullivan. Among my<br>
critics, Paul Goodman most radically obliged me to revise my thinking. Robert Silvers<br>
provided me with brilliant editorial assistance on Chapters 1, 3, and 6, which have<br>
appeared in The New York Review of Books.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Reimer and I have decided to publish separate views of our joint research. He is working<br>
on a comprehensive and documented exposition, which will be subjected to several<br>
months of further critical appraisal and be published late in 1971 by Doubleday &amp;<br>
Company. Dennis Sullivan, who acted as secretary at the meetings between Reimer and</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 2</p></div><div><p dir="auto">myself, is preparing a book for publication in the spring of 1972 which will place my<br>
argument in the context of current debate about public schooling in the United States. I<br>
offer this volume of essays now in the hope that it will provoke additional critical<br>
contributions to the sessions of a seminar on "Alternatives in Education" planned at<br>
CIDOC in Cuernavaca for 1972 and 1973.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I intend to discuss some perplexing issues which are raised once we embrace the<br>
hypothesis that society can be deschooled; to search for criteria which may help us<br>
distinguish institutions which merit development because they support learning in a<br>
deschooled milieu; and to clarify those personal goals which would foster the advent of<br>
an Age of Leisure (schole) as opposed to an economy dominated by service industries.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">IVAN ILLICH</p></div><div><p dir="auto">CIDOC</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Cuernavaca, Mexico<br>
November, 1970</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 3</p></div><div><p dir="auto">1</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Why We Must Disestablish School</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what the schools do for<br>
them. They school them to confuse process and substance. Once these become blurred, a<br>
new logic is assumed: the more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation<br>
leads to success. The pupil is thereby "schooled" to confuse teaching with learning, grade<br>
advancement with education, a diploma with competence, and fluency with the ability to<br>
say something new. His imagination is "schooled" to accept service in place of value.<br>
Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the improvement of<br>
community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national security, the rat<br>
race for productive work. Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavor<br>
are defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which claim to serve<br>
these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on allocating more resources to the<br>
management of hospitals, schools, and other agencies in question.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In these essays, I will show that the institutionalization of values leads inevitably to<br>
physical pollution, social polarization, and psychological impotence: three dimensions in<br>
a process of global degradation and modernized misery. I will explain how this process of<br>
degradation is accelerated when nonmaterial needs are transformed into demands for<br>
commodities; when health, education, personal mobility, welfare, or psychological<br>
healing are defined as the result of services or "treatments." I do this because I believe<br>
that most of the research now going on about the future tends to advocate further<br>
increases in the institutionalization of values and that we must define conditions which<br>
would permit precisely the contrary to happen. We need research on the possible use of<br>
technology to create institutions which serve personal, creative, and autonomous<br>
interaction and the emergence of values which cannot be substantially controlled by<br>
technocrats. We need counterfoil research to current futurology.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I want to raise the general question of the mutual definition of man's nature and the<br>
nature of modem institutions which characterizes our world view and language. To do so,<br>
I have chosen the school as my paradigm, and I therefore deal only indirectly with other<br>
bureaucratic agencies of the corporate state: the consumer-family, the party, the army, the<br>
church, the media. My analysis of the hidden curriculum of school should make it evident<br>
that public education would profit from the deschooling of society, just as family life,<br>
politics, security, faith, and communication would profit from an analogous process.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 4</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I begin my analysis, in this first essay, by trying to convey what the deschooling of a<br>
schooled society might mean. In this context, it should be easier to understand my choice<br>
of the five specific aspects relevant to this process with which I deal in the subsequent<br>
chapters.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Not only education but social reality itself has become schooled. It costs roughly the<br>
same to school both rich and poor in the same dependency. The yearly expenditure per<br>
pupil in the slums and in the rich suburbs of any one of twenty U.S. cities lies in the same<br>
range-and sometimes is favorable to the poor. [?* Penrose B. Jackson, Trends in<br>
Elementary and Secondary Education Expenditures: Central City and Suburban<br>
Comparisons 1965 to 1968, U.S. Office of Education, Office of Program and Planning<br>
Evaluation, June 1969] Rich and poor alike depend on schools and hospitals which guide<br>
their lives, form their world view, and define for them what is legitimate and what is not.<br>
Both view doctoring oneself as irresponsible, learning on one's own as unreliable, and<br>
community organization, when not paid for by those in authority, as a form of aggression<br>
or subversion. For both groups the reliance on institutional treatment renders independent<br>
accomplishment suspect. The progressive underdevelopment of self- and community-<br>
reliance is even more typical in Westchester than it is in the northeast of Brazil.<br>
Everywhere not only education but society as a whole needs "deschooling."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Welfare bureaucracies claim a professional, political, and financial monopoly over the<br>
social imagination, setting standards of what is valuable and what is feasible. This<br>
monopoly is at the root of the modernization of poverty. Every simple need to which an<br>
institutional answer is found permits the invention of a new class of poor and a new<br>
definition of poverty. Ten years ago in Mexico it was the normal thing to be bom and to<br>
die in one's own home and to be buried by one's friends. Only the soul's needs were taken<br>
care of by the institutional church. Now to begin and end life at home become signs<br>
either of poverty or of special privilege. Dying and death have come under the<br>
institutional management of doctors and undertakers.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Once basic needs have been translated by a society into demands for scientifically<br>
produced commodities, poverty is defined by standards which the technocrats can change<br>
at will. Poverty then refers to those who have fallen behind an advertised ideal of<br>
consumption in some important respect. In Mexico the poor are those who lack three<br>
years of schooling, and in New York they are those who lack twelve.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The poor have always been socially powerless. The increasing reliance on institutional<br>
care adds a new dimension to their helplessness: psychological impotence, the inability to<br>
fend for themselves. Peasants on the high plateau of the Andes are exploited by the<br>
landlord and the merchant-once they settle in Lima they are, in addition, dependent on<br>
political bosses, and disabled by their lack of schooling. Modernized poverty combines<br>
the lack of power over circumstances with a loss of personal potency. This modernization<br>
of poverty is a world-wide phenomenon, and lies at the root of contemporary<br>
underdevelopment. Of course it appears under different guises in rich and in poor<br>
countries.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 5</p></div><div><p dir="auto">It is probably most intensely felt in U.S. cities. Nowhere else is poverty treated at greater<br>
cost. Nowhere else does the treatment of poverty produce so much dependence, anger,<br>
frustration, and further demands. And nowhere else should it be so evident that poverty-<br>
once it has become modemized-has become resistant to treatment with dollars alone and<br>
requires an institutional revolution.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Today in the United States the black and even the migrant can aspire to a level of<br>
professional treatment which would have been unthinkable two generations ago, and<br>
which seems grotesque to most people in the Third World. For instance, the U.S. poor<br>
can count on a truant officer to return their children to school until they reach seventeen,<br>
or on a doctor to assign them to a hospital bed which costs sixty dollars per day-the<br>
equivalent of three months' income for a majority of the people in the world. But such<br>
care only makes them dependent on more treatment, and renders them increasingly<br>
incapable of organizing their own lives around their own experiences and resources<br>
within their own communities.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The poor in the United States are in a unique position to speak about the predicament<br>
which threatens all the poor in a modernizing world. They are making the discovery that<br>
no amount of dollars can remove the inherent destructiveness of welfare institutions, once<br>
the professional hierarchies of these institutions have convinced society that their<br>
ministrations are morally necessary. The poor in the U.S. inner city can demonstrate from<br>
their own experience the fallacy on which social legislation in a "schooled" society is<br>
built.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Supreme Court Justice William 0. Douglas observed that "the only way to establish an<br>
institution is to finance it." The corollary is also true. Only by channeling dollars away<br>
from the institutions which now treat health, education, and welfare can the further<br>
impoverishment resulting from their disabling side effects be stopped.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">This must be kept in mind when we evaluate federal aid pro-grams. As a case in point,<br>
between 1965 and 1968 over three billion dollars were spent in U.S. schools to offset the<br>
disadvantages of about six million children. The program is known as Title One. It is the<br>
most expensive compensatory program ever attempted anywhere in education, yet no<br>
significant improvement can be detected in the learning of these "disadvantaged"<br>
children. Compared with their classmates from middle income homes, they have fallen<br>
further behind. Moreover, in the course of this program, professionals discovered an<br>
additional ten million children laboring under economic and educational handicaps. More<br>
reasons for claiming more federal funds are now at hand.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">This total failure to improve the education of the poor despite more costly treatment can<br>
be explained in three ways:</p></div><div><ol>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">Three billion dollars are insufficient to improve the perform-ance of six<br>
million children by a measurable amount; or</li>
</ol></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 6</p></div><div><ol start="2">
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">
<p>The money was incompetently spent: different curricula, better<br>
administration, further concentration of the funds on the poor child, and<br>
more research are needed and would do the trick; or</p>
</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto">
<p>Educational disadvantage cannot be cured by relying on education<br>
within the school.</p>
</li>
</ol></div><div><p dir="auto">The first is certainly true so long as the money has been spent through the school budget.<br>
The money indeed went to the schools which contained most of the disadvantaged<br>
children, but it was not spent on the poor children themselves. These children for whom<br>
the money was intended comprised only about half of those who were attending the<br>
schools that added the federal subsidies to their budgets. Thus the money was spent for<br>
custodial care, indoctrination and the selection of social roles, as well as education, all of<br>
which functions are inextricably mingled in the physical plants, curricula, teachers,<br>
administrators, and other key components of these schools, and, therefore, in their<br>
budgets.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The added funds enabled schools to cater disproportionately to the satisfaction of the<br>
relatively richer children who were "disadvantaged" by having to attend school in the<br>
company of the poor. At best a small fraction of each dollar intended to remedy a poor<br>
child's disadvantages in learning could reach the child through the school budget.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">It might be equally true that the money was incompetently spent. But even unusual<br>
incompetence cannot beat that of the school system. Schools by their very structure resist<br>
the concentration of privilege on those otherwise disadvantaged. Special curricula,<br>
separate classes, or longer hours only constitute more discrimination at a higher cost.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Taxpayers are not yet accustomed to permitting three billion dollars to vanish from HEW<br>
as if it were the Pentagon. The present Administration may believe that it can afford the<br>
wrath of educators. Middle-class Americans have nothing to lose if the program is cut.<br>
Poor parents think they do, but, even more, they are demanding control of the funds<br>
meant for their children. A logical way of cutting the budget and, one hopes, of<br>
increasing benefits is a system of tuition grants such as that proposed by Milton Friedman<br>
and others. Funds would be channeled to the beneficiary, enabling him to buy his share of<br>
the schooling of his choice. If such credit were limited to purchases which fit into a<br>
school curriculum, it would tend to provide greater equality of treatment, but would not<br>
thereby increase the equality of social claims.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">It should be obvious that even with schools of equal quality a poor child can seldom catch<br>
up with a rich one. Even if they attend equal schools and begin at the same age, poor<br>
children lack most of the educational opportunities which are casually available to the<br>
middle-class child. These advantages range from conversation and books in the home to<br>
vacation travel and a different sense of oneself, and apply, for the child who enjoys them,<br>
both in and out of school. So the poorer student will generally fall behind so long as he</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 7</p></div><div><p dir="auto">depends on school for advancement or learning. The poor need funds to enable them to<br>
learn, not to get certified for the treatment of their alleged disproportionate deficiencies.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">All this is true in poor nations as well as in rich ones, but there it appears under a<br>
different guise. Modernized poverty in poor nations affects more people more visibly but<br>
also-for the moment-more superficially. Two-thirds of all children in Latin America leave<br>
school before finishing the fifth grade, but these "desertores" are not therefore as badly<br>
off as they would be in the United States.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Few countries today remain victims of classical poverty, which was stable and less<br>
disabling. Most countries in Latin America have reached the "take-off" point toward<br>
economic development and competitive consumption, and thereby toward modernized<br>
poverty: their citizens have learned to think rich and live poor. Their laws make six to ten<br>
years of school obligatory. Not only in Argentina but also in Mexico or Brazil the<br>
average citizen defines an adequate education by North American standards, even though<br>
the chance of getting such prolonged schooling is limited to a tiny minority. In these<br>
countries the majority is already hooked on school, that is, they are schooled in a sense of<br>
inferiority toward the better- schooled. Their fanaticism in favor of school makes it<br>
possible to exploit them doubly: it permits increasing allocation of public funds for the<br>
education of a few and increasing acceptance of social control by the many.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Paradoxically, the belief that universal schooling is absolutely necessary is most firmly<br>
held in those countries where the fewest people have been-and will be-served by schools.<br>
Yet in Latin America different paths toward education could still be taken by the majority<br>
of parents and children. Proportionately, national savings invested in schools and teachers<br>
might be higher than in rich countries, but these investments are totally insufficient to<br>
serve the majority by making even four years of school attendance possible. Fidel Castro<br>
talks as if he wanted to go in the direction of deschooling when he promises that by 1980<br>
Cuba will be able to dissolve its university since all of life in Cuba will be an educational<br>
experience. At the grammar-school and high-school level, however, Cuba, like all other<br>
Latin- American countries, acts as though passage through a period defined as the "school<br>
age" were an unquestionable goal for all, delayed merely by a temporary shortage of<br>
resources.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The twin deceptions of increased treatment, as actually provided in the United States and<br>
as merely promised in Latin America complement each other. The Northern poor are<br>
being disabled by the same twelve-year treatment whose lack brands the Southern poor as<br>
hopelessly backward. Neither in North America nor in Latin America do the poor get<br>
equality from obligatory schools. But in both places the mere existence of school<br>
discourages and disables the poor from taking control of their own learning. All over the<br>
world the school has an anti-educational effect on society: school is recognized as the<br>
institution which specializes in education. The failures of school are taken by most people<br>
as a proof that education is a very costly, very complex, always arcane, and frequently<br>
almost impossible task.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 8</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School appropriates the money, men, and good will available for education and in<br>
addition discourages other institutions from assuming educational tasks. Work, leisure,<br>
politics, city living, and even family life depend on schools for the habits and knowledge<br>
they presuppose, instead of becoming themselves the means of education. Simultaneously<br>
both schools and the other institutions which depend on them are priced out of the<br>
market.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In the United States the per capita costs of schooling have risen almost as fast as the cost<br>
of medical treatment. But increased treatment by both doctors and teachers has shown<br>
steadily declining results. Medical expenses concentrated on those above forty-five have<br>
doubled several times over a period of forty years with a resulting 3 percent increase in<br>
life expectancy in men. The increase in educational expenditures has produced even<br>
stranger results; otherwise President Nixon could not have been moved this spring to<br>
promise that every child shall soon have the "Right to Read" before leaving school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In the United States it would take eighty billion dollars per year to provide what<br>
educators regard as equal treatment for all in grammar and high school. This is well over<br>
twice the $36 billion now being spent. Independent cost projections prepared at HEW and<br>
the University of Florida indicate that by 1974 the comparable figures will be $107<br>
billion as against the $45 billion now projected, and these figures wholly omit the<br>
enormous costs of what is called "higher education," for which demand is growing even<br>
faster. The United States, which spent nearly eighty billion dollars in 1969 for "defense"<br>
including its deployment in Vietnam, is obviously too poor to provide equal schooling.<br>
The President's committee for the study of school finance should ask not how to support<br>
or how to trim such increasing costs, but how they can be avoided.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Equal obligatory schooling must be recognized as at least economically unfeasible. In<br>
Latin America the amount of public money spent on each graduate student is between<br>
350 and 1,500 times the amount spent on the median citizen (that is, the citizen who<br>
holds the middle ground between the poorest and the richest). In the United States the<br>
discrepancy is smaller, but the discrimination is keener. The richest parents, some 10<br>
percent, can afford private education for their children and help them to benefit from<br>
foundation grants. But in addition they obtain ten times the per capita amount of public<br>
funds if this is compared with the per capita expenditure made on the children of the 10<br>
percent who are poorest. The principal reasons for this are that rich children stay longer<br>
in school, that a year in a university is disproportionately more expensive than a year in<br>
high school, and that most private universities depend-at least indirectly-on tax-derived<br>
finances.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Obligatory schooling inevitably polarizes a society; it also grades the nations of the world<br>
according to an international caste system. Countries are rated like castes whose<br>
educational dignity is determined by the average years of schooling of its citizens, a<br>
rating which is closely related to per capita gross national product, and much more<br>
painful.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 9</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The paradox of the schools is evident: increased expenditure escalates their<br>
destructiveness at home and abroad. This paradox must be made a public issue. It is now<br>
generally accepted that the physical environment will soon be destroyed by biochemical<br>
pollution unless we reverse current trends in the production of physical goods. It should<br>
also be recognized that social and personal life is threatened equally by HEW pollution,<br>
the inevitable by-product of obligatory and competitive consumption of welfare.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The escalation of the schools is as destructive as the escalation of weapons but less<br>
visibly so. Everywhere in the world school costs have risen faster than enrollments and<br>
faster than the GNP; everywhere expenditures on school fall even further behind the<br>
expectations of parents, teachers, and pupils. Everywhere this situation discourages both<br>
the motivation and the financing for large-scale planning for nonschooled learning. The<br>
United States is proving to the world that no country can be rich enough to afford a<br>
school system that meets the demands this same system creates simply by existing,<br>
because a successful school system schools parents and pupils to the supreme value of a<br>
larger school system, the cost of which increases disproportionately as higher grades are<br>
in demand and become scarce.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Rather than calling equal schooling temporarily unfeasible, we must recognize that it is,<br>
in principle, economically absurd, and that to attempt it is intellectually emasculating,<br>
socially polarizing, and destructive of the credibility of the political system which<br>
promotes it. The ideology of obligatory schooling admits of no logical limits. The White<br>
House recently provided a good example. Dr. Hutschnecker, the "psychiatrist" who<br>
treated Mr. Nixon before he was qualified as a candidate, recommended to the President<br>
that all children between six and eight be professionally examined to ferret out those who<br>
have destructive tendencies, and that obligatory treatment be provided for them. If<br>
necessary, their re-education in special institutions should be required. This memorandum<br>
from his doctor the President sent for evaluation to HEW. Indeed, preventive<br>
concentration camps for predelinquents would be a logical improvement over the school<br>
system.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Equal educational opportunity is, indeed, both a desirable and a feasible goal, but to<br>
equate this with obligator;' schooling is to confuse salvation with the Church. School has<br>
become the world religion of a modernized proletariat, and makes futile promises of<br>
salvation to the poor of the technological age. The nation-state has adopted it, drafting all<br>
citizens into a graded curriculum leading to sequential diplomas not unlike the initiation<br>
rituals and hieratic promotions of former times. The modern state has assumed the duty<br>
of enforcing the judgment of its educators through well-meant truant officers and job<br>
requirements, much as did the Spanish kings who enforced the judgments of their<br>
theologians through the conquistadors and the Inquisition.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Two centuries ago the United States led the world in a movement to disestablish the<br>
monopoly of a single church. Now we need the constitutional disestablishment of the<br>
monopoly of the school, and thereby of a system which legally combines prejudice with<br>
discrimination. The first article of a bill of rights for a modern, humanist society would<br>
correspond to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: "The State shall make no</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 10</p></div><div><p dir="auto">law with respect to the establishment of education." There shall be no ritual obligatory for<br>
all.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To make this disestablishment effective, we need a law forbidding discrimination in<br>
hiring, voting, or admission to centers of learning based on previous attendance at some<br>
curriculum. This guarantee would not exclude performance tests of competence for a<br>
function or role, but would remove the present absurd discrimination in favor of the<br>
person who leams a given skill with the largest expenditure of public funds or what is<br>
equally likely has been able to obtain a diploma which has no relation to any useful skill<br>
or job. Only by protecting the citizen from being disqualified by anything in his career in<br>
school can a constitutional disestablishment of school become psychologically effective.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Neither learning nor justice is promoted by schooling because educators insist on<br>
packaging instruction with certification. Learning and the assignment of social roles are<br>
melted into schooling. Yet to learn means to acquire a new skill or insight, while<br>
promotion depends on an opinion which others have formed. Learning frequently is the<br>
result of instruction, but selection for a role or category in the job market increasingly<br>
depends on mere length of attendance.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Instruction is the choice of circumstances which facilitate learning. Roles are assigned by<br>
setting a curriculum of conditions which the candidate must meet if he is to make the<br>
grade. School links instruction but not learning to these roles. This is neither reasonable<br>
nor liberating. It is not reasonable because it does not link relevant qualities or<br>
competences to roles, but rather the process by which such qualities are supposed to be<br>
acquired. It is not liberating or educational because school reserves instruction to those<br>
whose every step in learning fits previously approved measures of social control.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Curriculum has always been used to assign social rank. At times it could be prenatal:<br>
karma ascribes you to a caste and lineage to the aristocracy. Curriculum could take the<br>
form of a ritual, of sequential sacred ordinations, or it could consist of a succession of<br>
feats in war or hunting, or further advancement could be made to depend on a series of<br>
previous princely favors. Universal schooling was meant to detach role assignment from<br>
personal life history: it was meant to give everybody an equal chance to any office. Even<br>
now many people wrongly believe that school ensures the dependence of public trust on<br>
relevant learning achievements. However, instead of equalizing chances, the school<br>
system has monopolized their distribution.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To detach competence from curriculum, inquiries into a man's learning history must be<br>
made taboo, like inquiries into his political affiliation, church attendance, lineage, sex<br>
habits, or racial background. Laws forbidding discrimination on the basis of prior<br>
schooling must be enacted. Laws, of course, cannot stop prejudice against the<br>
unschooled-nor are they meant to force anyone to intermarry with an autodidact but they<br>
can discourage unjustified discrimination.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A second major illusion on which the school system rests is that most learning is the<br>
result of teaching. Teaching, it is true, may contribute to certain kinds of learning under</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 11</p></div><div><p dir="auto">certain circumstances. But most people acquire most of their knowledge outside school,<br>
and in school only insofar as school, in a few rich countries, has become their place of<br>
confinement during an increasing part of their lives.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Most learning happens casually, and even most intentional learning is not the result of<br>
programmed instruction. Normal children learn their first language casually, although<br>
faster if their parents pay attention to them. Most people who learn a second language<br>
well do so as a result of odd circumstances and not of sequential teaching. They go to live<br>
with their grandparents, they travel, or they fall in love with a foreigner. Fluency in<br>
reading is also more often than not a result of such extracurricular activities. Most people<br>
who read widely, and with pleasure, merely believe that they learned to do so in school;<br>
when challenged, they easily discard this illusion.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">But the fact that a great deal of learning even now seems to happen casually and as a by-<br>
product of some other activity defined as work or leisure does not mean that planned<br>
learning does not benefit from planned instruction and that both do not stand in need of<br>
improvement. The strongly motivated student who is faced with the task of acquiring a<br>
new and complex skill may benefit greatly from the discipline now associated with the<br>
old-fashioned schoolmaster who taught reading, Hebrew, catechism, or multiplication by<br>
rote. School has now made this kind of drill teaching rare and disreputable, yet there are<br>
many skills which a motivated student with normal aptitude can master in a matter of a<br>
few months if taught in this traditional way. This is as true of codes as of their<br>
encipherment; of second and third languages as of reading and writing; and equally of<br>
special languages such as algebra, computer programming, chemical analysis, or of<br>
manual skills like typing, watchmaking, plumbing, wiring, TV repair; or for that matter<br>
dancing, driving, and diving.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In certain cases acceptance into a learning program aimed at a specific skill might<br>
presuppose competence in some other skill, but it should certainly not be made to depend<br>
upon the process by which such prerequisite skills were acquired. TV repair presupposes<br>
literacy and some math; diving, good swimming; and driving, very little of either.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Progress in learning skills is measurable. The optimum resources in time and materials<br>
needed by an average motivated adult can be easily estimated. The cost of teaching a<br>
second Western European language to a high level of fluency ranges between four and<br>
six hundred dollars in the United States, and for an Oriental tongue the time needed for<br>
instruction might be doubled. This would still be very little compared with the cost of<br>
twelve years of schooling in New York City (a condition for acceptance of a worker into<br>
the Sanitation Department) almost fifteen thousand dollars. No doubt not only the teacher<br>
but also the printer and the pharmacist protect their trades through the public illusion that<br>
training for them is very expensive.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At present schools pre-empt most educational funds. Drill instruction which costs less<br>
than comparable schooling is now a privilege of those rich enough to bypass the schools,<br>
and those whom either the army or big business sends through in-service training. In a<br>
program of progressive deschooling of U.S. education, at first the resources available for</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 12</p></div><div><p dir="auto">drill training would be limited. But ultimately there should be no obstacle for anyone at<br>
any time of his life to be able to choose instruction among hundreds of definable skills at<br>
public expense.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Right now educational credit good at any skill center could be provided in limited<br>
amounts for people of all ages, and not just to the poor. I envisage such credit in the form<br>
of an educational passport or an "edu-credit card" provided to each citizen at birth. In<br>
order to favor the poor, who probably would not use their yearly grants early in life, a<br>
provision could be made that interest accrued to later users of cumulated "entitlements."<br>
Such credits would permit most people to acquire the skills most in demand, at their<br>
convenience, better, faster, cheaper, and with fewer undesirable side effects than in<br>
school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Potential skill teachers are never scarce for long because, on the one hand, demand for a<br>
skill grows only with its performance within a community and, on the other, a man<br>
exercising a skill could also teach it. But, at present, those using skills which are in<br>
demand and do require a human teacher are discouraged from sharing these skills with<br>
others. This is done either by teachers who monopolize the licenses or by unions which<br>
protect their trade interests. Skill centers which would be judged by customers on their<br>
results, and not on the personnel they employ or the process they use, would open<br>
unsuspected working opportunities, frequently even for those who are now considered<br>
unemployable. Indeed, there is no reason why such skill centers should not be at the work<br>
place itself, with the employer and his work force supplying instruction as well as jobs to<br>
those who choose to use their educational credits in this way.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In 1956 there arose a need to teach Spanish quickly to several hundred teachers, social<br>
workers, and ministers from the New York Archdiocese so that they could communicate<br>
with Puerto Ricans. My friend Gerry Morris announced over a Spanish radio station that<br>
he needed native speakers from Harlem. Next day some two hundred teen-agers lined up<br>
in front of his office, and he selected four dozen of them-many of them school dropouts.<br>
He trained them in the use of the U.S. Foreign Service Institute (FSI) Spanish manual,<br>
designed for use by linguists with graduate training, and within a week his teachers were<br>
on their own-each in charge of four New Yorkers who wanted to speak the language.<br>
Within six months the mission was accomplished. Cardinal Spellman could claim that he<br>
had 127 parishes in which at least three staff members could communicate in Spanish. No<br>
school program could have matched these results.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Skill teachers are made scarce by the belief in the value of licenses. Certification<br>
constitutes a form of market manipulation and is plausible only to a schooled mind. Most<br>
teachers of arts and trades are less skillful, less inventive, and less communicative than<br>
the best craftsmen and tradesmen. Most high-school teachers of Spanish or French do not<br>
speak the language as correctly as their pupils might after half a year of competent drills.<br>
Experiments conducted by Angel Quintero in Puerto Rico suggest that many young teen-<br>
agers, if given the proper incentives, programs, and access to tools, are better than most<br>
schoolteachers at introducing their peers to the scientific exploration of plants, stars, and<br>
matter, and to the discovery of how and why a motor or a radio functions.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 13</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Opportunities for skill-learning can be vastly multiplied if we open the "market." This<br>
depends on matching the right teacher with the right student when he is highly motivated<br>
in an intelligent program, without the constraint of curriculum.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Free and competing drill instruction is a subversive blasphemy to the orthodox educator.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">It dissociates the acquisition of skills from "humane" education, which schools package<br>
together, and thus it promotes unlicensed learning no less than unlicensed teaching for<br>
unpredictable purposes.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">There is currently a proposal on record which seems at first to make a great deal of sense.<br>
It has been prepared by Christopher Jencks of the Center for the Study of Public Policy<br>
and is sponsored by the Office of Economic Opportunity. It proposes to put educational<br>
"entitlements" or tuition grants into the hands of parents and students for expenditure in<br>
the schools of their choice. Such individual entitlements could indeed be an important<br>
step in the right direction. We need a guarantee of the right of each citizen to an equal<br>
share of tax-derived educational resources, the right to verify this share, and the right to<br>
sue for it if denied. It is one form of a guarantee against regressive taxation.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Jencks proposal, however, begins with the ominous statement that "conservatives,<br>
liberals, and radicals have all complained at one time or another that the American<br>
educational system gives professional educators too little incentive to provide high<br>
quality education to most children." The proposal condemns itself by proposing tuition<br>
grants which would have to be spent on schooling.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">This is like giving a lame man a pair of crutches and stipulating that he use them only if<br>
the ends are tied together. As the proposal for tuition grants now stands, it plays into the<br>
hands not only of the professional educators but of racists, promoters of religious schools,<br>
and others whose interests are socially divisive. Above all, educational entitlements<br>
restricted to use within schools play into the hands of all those who want to continue to<br>
live in a society in which social advancement is tied not to proven knowledge but to the<br>
learning pedigree by which it is supposedly acquired. This discrimination in favor of<br>
schools which dominates Jencks's discussion on refinancing education could discredit<br>
one of the most critically needed principles for educational reform: the return of initiative<br>
and accountability for learning to the learner or his most immediate tutor.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The deschooling of society implies a recognition of the two-faced nature of learning. An<br>
insistence on skill drill alone could be a disaster; equal emphasis must be placed on other<br>
kinds of learning. But if schools are the wrong places for learning a skill, they are even<br>
worse places for getting an education. School does both tasks badly, partly because it<br>
does not distinguish between them. School is inefficient in skill instruction especially<br>
because it is curricular. In most schools a program which is meant to improve one skill is<br>
chained always to another irrelevant task. History is tied to advancement in math, and<br>
class attendance to the right to use the playground.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Schools are even less efficient in the arrangement of the circumstances which encourage<br>
the open-ended, exploratory use of acquired skills, for which I will reserve the term</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 14</p></div><div><p dir="auto">"liberal education." The main reason for this is that school is obligatory and becomes<br>
schooling for schooling's sake: an enforced stay in the company of teachers, which pays<br>
off in the doubtful privilege of more such company. Just as skill instruction must be freed<br>
from curricular restraints, so must liberal education be dissociated from obligatory<br>
attendance. Both skill-learning and education for inventive and creative behavior can be<br>
aided by institutional arrangement, but they are of a different, frequently opposed nature.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Most skills can be acquired and improved by drills, because skill implies the mastery of<br>
definable and predictable behavior. Skill instruction can rely, therefore, on the simulation<br>
of circumstances in which the skill will be used. Education in the exploratory and<br>
creative use of skills, however, cannot rely on drills. Education can be the outcome of<br>
instruction, though instruction of a kind fundamentally opposed to drill. It relies on the<br>
relationship between partners who already have some of the keys which give access to<br>
memories stored in and by the community. It relies on the critical intent of all those who<br>
use memories creatively. It relies on the surprise of the unexpected question which opens<br>
new doors for the inquirer and his partner.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The skill instructor relies on the arrangement of set circumstances which permit the<br>
learner to develop standard responses. The educational guide or master is concerned with<br>
helping matching partners to meet so that learning can take place. He matches individuals<br>
starting from their own, unresolved questions. At the most he helps the pupil to formulate<br>
his puzzlement since only a clear statement will give him the power to find his match,<br>
moved like him, at the moment, to explore the same issue in the same context.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Matching partners for educational purposes initially seems more difficult to imagine than<br>
finding skill instructors and partners for a game. One reason is the deep fear which school<br>
has implanted in us, a fear which makes us censorious. The unlicensed exchange of<br>
skills-even undesirable skills-is more predictable and therefore seems less dangerous than<br>
the unlimited opportunity for meeting among people who share an issue which for them,<br>
at the moment, is socially, intellectually, and emotionally important.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Brazilian teacher Paulo Freire knows this from experience. He discovered that any<br>
adult can begin to read in a matter of forty hours if the first words he deciphers are<br>
charged with political meaning. Freire trains his teachers to move into a village and to<br>
discover the words which designate current important issues, such as the access to a well<br>
or the compound interest on the debts owed to the patron. In the evening the villagers<br>
meet for the discussion of these key words. They begin to realize that each word stays on<br>
the blackboard even after its sound has faded. The letters continue to unlock reality and to<br>
make it manageable as a problem. I have frequently witnessed how discussants grow in<br>
social awareness and how they are impelled to take political action as fast as they learn to<br>
read. They seem to take reality into their hands as they write it down.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I remember the man who complained about the weight of pencils: they were difficult to<br>
handle because they did not weigh as much as a shovel; and I remember another who on<br>
his way to work stopped with his Companions and wrote the word they were discussing<br>
with his hoe on the ground: "agua. " Since 1962 my friend Freire has moved from exile to</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 15</p></div><div><p dir="auto">exile, mainly because he refuses to conduct his sessions around words which are<br>
preselected by approved educators, rather than those which his discussants bring to the<br>
class.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The educational matchmaking among people who have been successfully schooled is a<br>
different task. Those who do not need such assistance are a minority, even among the<br>
readers of serious journals. The majority cannot and should not be rallied for discussion<br>
around a slogan, a word, or a picture. But the idea remains the same: they should be able<br>
to meet around a problem chosen and defined by their own initiative. Creative,<br>
exploratory learning requires peers currently puzzled about the same terms or problems.<br>
Large universities make the futile attempt to match them by multiplying their courses,<br>
and they generally fail since they are bound to curriculum, course structure, and<br>
bureaucratic administration. In schools, including universities, most resources are spent<br>
to purchase the time and motivation of a limited number of people to take up<br>
predetermined problems in a ritually defined setting. The most radical alternative to<br>
school would be a network or service which gave each man the same opportunity to share<br>
his current concern with others motivated by the same concern.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Let me give, as an example of what I mean, a description of how an intellectual match<br>
might work in New York City. Each man, at any given moment and at a minimum price,<br>
could identify himself to a computer with his address and telephone number, indicating<br>
the book, article, film, or recording on which he seeks a partner for discussion. Within<br>
days he could receive by mail the list of others who recently had taken the same<br>
initiative. This list would enable him by telephone to arrange for a meeting with persons<br>
who initially would be known exclusively by the fact that they requested a dialogue about<br>
the same subject.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Matching people according to their interest in a particular title is radically simple. It<br>
permits identification only on the basis of a mutual desire to discuss a statement recorded<br>
by a third person, and it leaves the initiative of arranging the meeting to the individual.<br>
Three objections are usually raised against this skeletal purity. I take them up not only to<br>
clarify the theory that I want to illustrate by my proposal for they highlight the deep-<br>
seated resistance to deschooling education, to separating learning from social control but<br>
also because they may help to suggest existing resources which are not now used for<br>
learning purposes.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The first objection is: Why cannot self-identification be based also on an idea or an<br>
issue? Certainly such subjective terms could also be used in a computer system. Political<br>
parties, churches, unions, clubs, neighborhood centers, and professional societies already<br>
organize their educational activities in this way and in effect they act as schools. They all<br>
match people in order to explore certain "themes"; and these are dealt with in courses,<br>
seminars, and curricula in which presumed "common interests" are prepackaged. Such<br>
theme-matching is by definition teacher-centered: it requires an authoritarian presence to<br>
define for the participants the starting point for their discussion.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 16</p></div><div><p dir="auto">By contrast, matching by the title of a book, film, etc., in its pure form leaves it to the<br>
author to define the special language, the terms, and the framework within which a given<br>
problem or fact is stated; and it enables those who accept this starting point to identify<br>
themselves to one another. For instance, matching people around the idea of "cultural<br>
revolution" usually leads either to confusion or to demagoguery. On the other hand,<br>
matching those interested in helping each other understand a specific article by Mao,<br>
Marcuse, Freud, or Goodman stands in the great tradition of liberal learning from Plato's<br>
Dialogues, which are built around presumed statements by Socrates, to Aquinas's<br>
commentaries on Peter the Lombard. The idea of matching by title is thus radically<br>
different from the theory on which the "Great Books" clubs, for example, were built:<br>
instead of relying on the selection by some Chicago professors, any two partners can<br>
choose any book for further analysis.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The second objection asks: Why not let the identification of match seekers include<br>
information on age, background, world view, competence, experience, or other defining<br>
characteristics? Again, there is no reason why such discriminatory restrictions could not<br>
and should not be built into some of the many universities-with or without walls-which<br>
could use title-matching as their basic organizational device. I could conceive of a system<br>
designed to encourage meetings of interested persons at which the author of the book<br>
chosen would be present or represented; or a system which guaranteed the presence of a<br>
competent adviser; or one to which only students registered in a department or school had<br>
access; or one which permitted meetings only between people who defined their special<br>
approach to the title under discussion. Advantages for achieving specific goals of<br>
learning could be found for each of these restrictions. But I fear that, more often than not,<br>
the real reason for proposing such restrictions is contempt arising from the presumption<br>
that people are ignorant: educators want to avoid the ignorant meeting the ignorant<br>
around a text which they may not understand and which they read only because they are<br>
interested in it.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The third objection: Why not provide match seekers with incidental assistance that will<br>
facilitate their meetings-with space, schedules, screening, and protection? This is now<br>
done by schools with all the inefficiency characterizing large bureaucracies. If we left the<br>
initiative for meetings to the match seekers themselves, organizations which nobody now<br>
classifies as educational would probably do the job much better. I think of restaurant<br>
owners, publishers, telephone-answering services, department store managers, and even<br>
commuter train executives who could promote their services by rendering them attractive<br>
for educational meetings.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At a first meeting in a coffee shop, say, the partners might establish their identities by<br>
placing the book under discussion next to their cups. People who took the initiative to<br>
arrange for such meetings would soon learn what items to quote to meet the people they<br>
sought. The risk that the self-chosen discussion with one or several strangers might lead<br>
to a loss of time, disappointment, or even unpleasantness is certainly smaller than the<br>
same risk taken by a college applicant. A computer arranged meeting to discuss an article<br>
in a national magazine, held in a coffee shop off Fourth Avenue, would obligate none of<br>
the participants to stay in the company of his new acquaintances for longer than it took to</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 17</p></div><div><p dir="auto">drink a cup of coffee, nor would he have to meet any of them ever again. The chance that<br>
it would help to pierce the opaqueness of life in a modem city and further new friendship,<br>
self-chosen work, and critical reading is high. (The fact that a record of personal readings<br>
and meetings could be obtained thus by the FBI is undeniable; that this should still worry<br>
anybody in 1970 is only amusing to a free man, who willy-nilly contributes his share in<br>
order to drown snoopers in the irrelevancies they gather.)</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Both the exchange of skills and matching of partners are based on the assumption that<br>
education for all means education by all. Not the draft into a specialized institution but<br>
only the mobilization of the whole population can lead to popular culture. The equal right<br>
of each man to exercise his competence to learn and to instruct is now pre-empted by<br>
certified teachers. The teachers' competence, in turn, is restricted to what may be done in<br>
school. And, further, work and leisure are alienated from each other as a result: the<br>
spectator and the worker alike are supposed to arrive at the work place all ready to fit into<br>
a routine prepared for them. Adaptation in the form of a product's design, instruction, and<br>
publicity shapes them for their role as much as formal education by schooling. A radical<br>
alternative to a schooled society requires not only new formal mechanisms for the formal<br>
acquisition of skills and their educational use. A deschooled society implies a new<br>
approach to incidental or informal education.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Incidental education cannot any longer return to the forms which learning took in the<br>
village or the medieval town. Traditional society was more like a set of concentric circles<br>
of meaningful structures, while modem man must learn how to find meaning in many<br>
structures to which he is only marginally related. In the village, language and architecture<br>
and work and religion and family customs were consistent with one another, mutually<br>
explanatory and reinforcing. To grow into one implied a growth into the others. Even<br>
specialized apprenticeship was a by-product of specialized activities, such as shoemaking<br>
or the singing of psalms. If an apprentice never became a master or a scholar, he still<br>
contributed to making shoes or to making church services solemn. Education did not<br>
compete for time with either work or leisure. Almost all education was complex, lifelong,<br>
and unplanned.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Contemporary society is the result of conscious designs, and educational opportunities<br>
must be designed into them. Our reliance on specialized, full-time instruction through<br>
school will now decrease, and we must find more ways to learn and teach: the<br>
educational quality of all institutions must increase again. But this is a very ambiguous<br>
forecast. It could mean that men in the modem city will be increasingly the victims of an<br>
effective process of total instruction and manipulation once they are deprived of even the<br>
tenuous pretense of critical independence which liberal schools now provide for at least<br>
some of their pupils.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">It could also mean that men will shield themselves less behind certificates acquired in<br>
school and thus gain in courage to "talk back" and thereby control and instruct the<br>
institutions in which they participate. To ensure the latter we must learn to estimate the<br>
social value of work and leisure by the educational give-and. take for which they offer<br>
opportunity. Effective participation in the politics of a street, a work place, the library, a</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 18</p></div><div><p dir="auto">news program, or a hospital is therefore the best measuring stick to evaluate their level as<br>
educational institutions.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I recently spoke to a group of junior-high-school students in the process of organizing a<br>
resistance movement to their obligatory draft into the next class. Their slogan was<br>
"participation not simulation." They were disappointed that this was understood as a<br>
demand for less rather than for more education, and reminded me of the resistance which<br>
Karl Marx put up against a passage in the Gotha program which-one hundred years ago<br>
wanted to outlaw child labor. He opposed the proposal in the interest of the education of<br>
the young, which could happen only at work. If the greatest fruit of man's labor should be<br>
the education he receives from it and the opportunity which work gives him to initiate the<br>
education of others, then the alienation of modern society in a pedagogical sense is even<br>
worse than its economic alienation.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The major obstacle on the way to a society that truly educates was well defined by a<br>
black friend of mine in Chicago, who told me that our imagination was "all schooled up."<br>
We permit the state to ascertain the universal educational deficiencies of its citizens and<br>
establish one specialized agency to treat them. We thus share in the dyl5</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 19</p></div><div><p dir="auto">2</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Phenomenology of School</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Some words become so flexible that they cease to be useful "School" and "teaching" are<br>
such terms. Like an amoeba they fit into almost any interstice of the language. ABM will<br>
teach the Russians, IBM will teach Negro children, and the army can become the school<br>
of a nation.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The search for alternatives in education must therefore start with an agreement on what it<br>
is we mean by "school." This might be done in several ways. We could begin by listing<br>
the latent functions performed by modern school systems, such as custodial care,<br>
selection, indoctrination, and learning. We could make a client analysis and verify which<br>
of these latent functions render a service or a disservice to teachers, employers, children,<br>
parents, or the professions. We could survey the history of Western culture and the<br>
information gathered by anthropology in order to find institutions which played a role<br>
like that now performed by schooling. We could, finally, recall the many normative<br>
statements which have been made since the time of Comenius, or even since Quintilian,<br>
and discover which of these the modern school system most closely approaches. But any<br>
of these approaches would oblige us to start with certain assumptions about a relationship<br>
between school and education. To develop a language in which we can speak about<br>
school without such constant recourse to education, I have chosen to begin with<br>
something that might be called a phenomenology of public school. For this purpose I<br>
shall define "school" as the age-specific, teacher-related process requiring full-time<br>
attendance at an obligatory curriculum.</p></div><div><ol>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">Age School groups people according to age. This grouping rests on three unquestioned<br>
premises. Children belong in school.</li>
</ol></div><div><p dir="auto">Children learn in school. Children can be taught only in school. I think these unexamined<br>
premises deserve serious questioning. We have grown accustomed to children. We have<br>
decided that they should go to school, do as they are told, and have neither income nor<br>
families of their own. We expect them to know their place and behave like children. We<br>
remember, whether nostalgically or bitterly, a time when we were children, too. We are<br>
expected to tolerate the childish behavior of children. Man-kind, for us, is a species both<br>
afflicted and blessed with the task of caring for children. We forget, however, that our<br>
present concept of "childhood" developed only recently in Western Europe and more</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 20</p></div><div><p dir="auto">recently still in the Americas.<em> [</em> For parallel histories of modern capitalism and modern<br>
childhood see Philippe Aries, Centuries Of Childhood, Knopf, 1962.]</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Childhood as distinct from infancy, adolescence, or youth was unknown to most<br>
historical periods. Some Christian centuries did not even have an eye for its bodily<br>
proportions. Artists depicted the infant as a miniature adult seated on his mother's arm.<br>
Children appeared in Europe along with the pocket watch and the Christian moneylenders<br>
of the Renaissance. Before our century neither the poor nor the rich knew of children's<br>
dress, children's games, or the child's immunity from the law. Childhood belonged to the<br>
bourgeoisie. The worker's child, the peasant's child, and the nobleman's child all dressed<br>
the way their fathers dressed, played the way their fathers played, and were hanged by the<br>
neck as were their fathers. After the discovery of "childhood" by the bourgeoisie all this<br>
changed. Only some churches continued to respect for some time the dignity and maturity<br>
of the young. Until the Second Vatican Council, each child was instructed that a Christian<br>
reaches moral discernment and freedom at the age of seven, and from then on is capable<br>
of committing sins for which he may be punished by an eternity in Hell. Toward the<br>
middle of this century, middle-class parents began to try to spare their children the impact<br>
of this doctrine, and their thinking about children now prevails in the practice of the<br>
Church.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Until the last century, "children" of middle-class parents were made at home with the<br>
help of preceptors and private schools. Only with the advent of industrial society did the<br>
mass production of "childhood" become feasible and come within the reach of the<br>
masses. The school system is a modern phenomenon, as is the childhood it produces.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Since most people today live outside industrial cities, most people today do not<br>
experience childhood. In the Andes you till the soil once you have become "useful."<br>
Before that, you watch the sheep. If you are well nourished, you should be useful by<br>
eleven, and otherwise by twelve. Recently, I was talking to my night watchman, Marcos,<br>
about his eleven-year-old son who works in a barbershop. I noted in Spanish that his son<br>
was still a "ni-o, ” Marcos, surprised, answered with a guileless smile: "Don Ivan, I guess<br>
you're right." Realizing that until my remark the father had thought of Marcos primarily<br>
as his "son," I felt guilty for having drawn the curtain of childhood between two sensible<br>
persons. Of course if I were to tell the New York slum-dweller that his working son is<br>
still a "child," he would show no surprise. He knows quite well that his eleven-year-old<br>
son should be allowed childhood, and resents the fact that he is not. The son of Marcos<br>
has yet to be afflicted with the yearning for childhood; the New Yorker's son feels<br>
deprived.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Most people around the world, then, either do not want or cannot get modem childhood<br>
for their offspring. But it also seems that childhood is a burden to a good number of those<br>
few who are allowed it. Many of them are simply forced to go through it and are not at all<br>
happy playing the child's role. Growing up through childhood means being condemned to<br>
a process of in-human conflict between self-awareness and the role imposed by a society<br>
going through its own school age. Neither Stephen Daedalus nor Alexander Portnoy<br>
enjoyed childhood, and neither, I suspect, did many of us like to be treated as children.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 21</p></div><div><p dir="auto">If there were no age-specific and obligatory learning institution, "childhood" would go<br>
out of production. The youth of rich nations would be liberated from its destructiveness,<br>
and poor nations would cease attempting to rival the childishness of the rich. If society<br>
were to outgrow its age of childhood, it would have to become livable for the young. The<br>
present disjunction between an adult society which pretends to be humane and a school<br>
environment which mocks reality could no longer be maintained.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The disestablishment of schools could also end the present discrimination against infants,<br>
adults, and the old in favor of children throughout their adolescence and youth. The social<br>
decision to allocate educational resources preferably to those citizens who have outgrown<br>
the extraordinary learning capacity of their first four years and have not arrived at the<br>
height of their self-motivated learning will, in retrospect, probably appear as bizarre.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Institutional wisdom tells us that children need school. Institutional wisdom tells us that<br>
children leam in school. But this institutional wisdom is itself the product of schools<br>
because sound common sense tells us that only children can be taught in school. Only by<br>
segregating human beings in the category of childhood could we ever get them to submit<br>
to the authority of a schoolteacher.</p></div><div><ol start="2">
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">Teachers and Pupils By definition, children are pupils. The demand for the milieu of<br>
childhood creates an unlimited market for accredited teachers. School is an institution<br>
built on the axiom that learning is the result of teaching. And institutional wisdom<br>
continues to accept this axiom, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</li>
</ol></div><div><p dir="auto">We have all learned most of what we know outside school. Pupils do most of their<br>
learning without, and often despite, their teachers. Most tragically, the majority of men<br>
are taught their lesson by schools, even though they never go to school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Everyone learns how to live outside school. We learn to speak, to think, to love, to feel,<br>
to play, to curse, to politick, and to work without interference from a teacher. Even<br>
children who are under a teacher's care day and night are no exception to the rule.<br>
Orphans, idiots, and schoolteachers' sons leam most of what they learn outside the<br>
"educational" process planned for them. Teachers have made a poor showing in their<br>
attempts at increasing learning among the poor. Poor parents who want their children to<br>
go to school are less concerned about what they will learn than about the certificate and<br>
money they will earn. And middle-class parents commit their children to a teacher's care<br>
to keep them from learning what the poor leam on the streets. Increasingly educational<br>
research demonstrates that children leam most of what teachers pretend to teach them<br>
from peer groups, from comics, from chance observations, and above all from mere<br>
participation in the ritual of school. Teachers, more often than not, obstruct such learning<br>
of subject matters as goes on in school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Half of the people in our world never set foot in school. They have no contact with<br>
teachers, and they are deprived of the privilege of becoming dropouts. Yet they leam<br>
quite effectively the message which school teaches: that they should have school, and<br>
more and more of it. School instructs them in their own inferiority through the tax</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 22</p></div><div><p dir="auto">collector who makes them pay for it, or through the demagogue who raises their<br>
expectations of it, or through their children once the latter are hooked on it. So the poor<br>
are robbed of their self-respect by subscribing to a creed that grants salvation only<br>
through the school. At least the Church gave them a chance to repent at the hour of death.<br>
School leaves them with the expectation (a counterfeit hope) that their grandchildren will<br>
make it. That expectation is of course still more learning which comes from school but<br>
not from teachers.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Pupils have never credited teachers for most of their learning. Bright and dull alike have<br>
always relied on rote, reading, and wit to pass their exams, motivated by the stick or by<br>
the carrot of a desired career.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Adults tend to romanticize their schooling. In retrospect, they attribute their learning to<br>
the teacher whose patience they learned to admire. But the same adults would worry<br>
about the mental health of a child who rushed home to tell them what he learned from his<br>
every teacher.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Schools create jobs for schoolteachers, no matter what their pupils learn from them.</p></div><div><ol start="3">
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">Full-Time Attendance Every month I see another list of proposals made by some U.S.<br>
industry to AID, suggesting the replacement of Latin-American "classroom practitioners"<br>
either by disciplined systems administrators or just by TV. In the United States teaching<br>
as a team enterprise of educational researchers, designers, and technicians is gaining<br>
acceptance. But, no matter whether the teacher is a schoolmarm or a team of men in<br>
white coats, and no matter whether they succeed in teaching the subject matter listed in<br>
the catalogue or whether they fail, the professional teacher creates a sacred milieu.</li>
</ol></div><div><p dir="auto">Uncertainty about the future of professional teaching puts the classroom into jeopardy.<br>
Were educational professionals to specialize in promoting learning, they would have to<br>
abandon a system which calls for between 750 and 1,000 gatherings a year. But of course<br>
teachers do a lot more. The institutional wisdom of schools tells parents, pupils, and<br>
educators that the teacher, if he is to teach, must exercise his authority in a sacred<br>
precinct. This is true even for teachers whose pupils spend most of their school time in a<br>
classroom without walls.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School, by its very nature, tends to make a total claim on the time and energies of its<br>
participants. This, in turn, makes the teacher into custodian, preacher, and therapist.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In each of these three roles the teacher bases his authority on a different claim.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Th eteacher-as-custodian acts as a master of ceremonies, who guides his pupils through a<br>
drawn-out labyrinthine ritual. He arbitrates the observance of rules and administers the<br>
intricate rubrics of initiation to life. At his best, he sets the stage for the acquisition of<br>
some skill as schoolmasters always have. Without illusions of producing any profound<br>
learning, he drills his pupils in some basic routines.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 23</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The teacher-as-moralist substitutes for parents, God, or the state. He indoctrinates the<br>
pupil about what is right or wrong, not only in school but also in society at large. He<br>
stands in loco parentis for each one and thus ensures that all feel themselves children of<br>
the same state.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The teacher-as-therapist feels authorized to delve into the personal life of his pupil in<br>
order to help him grow as a person. When this function is exercised by a custodian and<br>
preacher, it usually means that he persuades the pupil to submit to a domestication of his<br>
vision of truth and his sense of what is right.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The claim that a liberal society can be founded on the modern school is paradoxical. The<br>
safeguards of individual freedom are all canceled in the dealings of a teacher with his<br>
pupil. When the schoolteacher fuses in his person the functions of judge, ideologue, and<br>
doctor, the fundamental style of society is perverted by the very process which should<br>
prepare for life. A teacher who combines these three powers contributes to the warping of<br>
the child much more than the laws which establish his legal or economic minority, or<br>
restrict his right to free assembly or abode.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Teachers are by no means the only professionals who offer therapy. Psychiatrists,<br>
guidance counselors, and job counselors, even lawyers, help their clients to decide, to<br>
develop their personalities, and to learn. Yet common sense tells the client that such<br>
professionals should abstain from imposing their opinion of what is right or wrong, or<br>
from forcing anyone to follow their advice. Schoolteachers and ministers are the only<br>
professionals who feel entitled to pry into the private affairs of their clients at the same<br>
time as they preach to a captive audience.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Children are protected by neither the First nor the Fifth Amendment when they stand<br>
before that secular priest, the teacher. The child must confront a man who wears an<br>
invisible triple crown, like the papal tiara, the symbol of triple authority combined in one<br>
person. For the child, the teacher pontificates as pastor, prophet, and priest-he is at once<br>
guide, teacher, and administrator of a sacred ritual. He combines the claims of medieval<br>
popes in a society constituted under the guarantee that these claims shall never be<br>
exercised together by one established and obligatory institution— church or state.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Defining children as full-time pupils permits the teacher to exercise a kind of power over<br>
their persons which is much less limited by constitutional and consuetudinal restrictions<br>
than the power wielded by the guardians of other social enclaves. Their chronological age<br>
disqualifies children from safeguards which are routine for adults in a modern asylum-<br>
madhouse, monastery, or jail.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Under the authoritative eye of the teacher, several orders of value collapse into one. The<br>
distinctions between morality, legal, ity, and personal worth are blurred and eventually<br>
eliminated. Each transgression is made to be felt as a multiple offense. The offender is<br>
expected to feel that he has broken a rule, that he has behaved immorally, and that he has<br>
let himself down. A pupil who adroitly obtains assistance on an exam is told that he is an<br>
outlaw, morally corrupt, and personally worthless.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 24</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Classroom attendance removes children from the everyday world of Western culture and<br>
plunges them into an environment far more primitive, magical, and deadly serious.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School could not create such an enclave within which the rules of ordinary reality are<br>
suspended, unless it physically incarcerated the young during many successive years on<br>
sacred territory. The attendance rule makes it possible for the schoolroom to serve as a<br>
magic womb, from which the child is delivered periodically at the school days and school<br>
year's completion until he is finally expelled into adult life. Neither universal extended<br>
childhood nor the smothering atmosphere of the classroom could exist without schools.<br>
Yet schools, as compulsory channels for learning, could exist without either and be more<br>
repressive and destructive than anything we have come to know. To understand what it<br>
means to deschool society, and not just to reform the educational establishment, we must<br>
now focus on the hidden curriculum of schooling. We are not concerned here, directly,<br>
with the hidden curriculum of the ghetto streets which brands the poor or with the hidden<br>
curriculum of the drawing room which benefits the rich. We are rather concerned to call<br>
attention to the fact that the ceremonial or ritual of schooling itself constitutes such a<br>
hidden curriculum. Even the best of teachers cannot entirely protect his pupils from it.<br>
Inevitably, this hidden curriculum of schooling adds prejudice and guilt to the<br>
discrimination which a society practices against some of its members and compounds the<br>
privilege of others with a new title to condescend to the majority. Just as inevitably, this<br>
hidden curriculum serves as a ritual of initiation into a growth-oriented consumer society<br>
for rich and poor alike.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 25</p></div><div><p dir="auto">3</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Ritualization of Progress</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The university graduate has been schooled for selective service among the rich of the<br>
world. Whatever his or her claims of solidarity with the Third World, each American<br>
college graduate has had an education costing an amount five times greater than the<br>
median life income of half of humanity. A Latin American student is introduced to this<br>
exclusive fraternity by having at least 350 times as much public money spent on his<br>
education as on that of his fellow citizens of median income. With very rare exceptions,<br>
the university graduate from a poor country feels more comfortable with his North<br>
American and European colleagues than with his nonschooled compatriots, and all<br>
students are academically processed to be happy only in the company of fellow<br>
consumers of the products of the educational machine.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The modern university confers the privilege of dissent on those who have been tested and<br>
classified as potential money-makers or power-holders. No one is given tax funds for the<br>
leisure in which to educate himself or the right to educate others unless at the same time<br>
he can also be certified for achievement. Schools select for each successive level those<br>
who have, at earlier stages in the game, proved themselves good risks for the established<br>
order. Having a monopoly on both the resources for learning and the investiture of social<br>
roles, the university coopts the discoverer and the potential dissenter. A degree always<br>
leaves its indelible price tag on the curriculum of its consumer. Certified college<br>
graduates fit only into a world which puts a price tag on their heads, thereby giving them<br>
the power to define the level of expectations in their society. In each country the amount<br>
of consumption by the college graduate sets the standard for all others; if they would be<br>
civilized people on or off the job, they will aspire to the style of life of college graduates.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The university thus has the effect of imposing consumer standards at work and at home,<br>
and it does so in every part of the world and under every political system. The fewer<br>
university graduates there are in a country, the more their cultivated demands are taken as<br>
models by the rest of the population. The gap between the consumption of the university<br>
graduate and that of the average citizen is even wider in Russia, China, and Algeria than<br>
in the United States. Cars, airplane trips, and tape recorders confer more visible<br>
distinction in a socialist country, where only a degree, and not just money, can procure<br>
them.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The ability of the university to fix consumer goals is something new. In many countries<br>
the university acquired this power only in the sixties, as the delusion of equal access to</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 26</p></div><div><p dir="auto">public education began to spread. Before that the university protected an individual's<br>
freedom of speech, but did not automatically convert his knowledge into wealth. To be a<br>
scholar in the Middle Ages meant to be poor, even a beggar. By virtue of his calling, the<br>
medieval scholar learned Latin, became an outsider worthy of the scorn as well as the<br>
esteem of peasant and prince, burgher and cleric. To get ahead in the world, the scholastic<br>
first had to enter it by joining the civil service, preferably that of the Church. The old<br>
university was a liberated zone for discovery and the discussion of ideas both new and<br>
old. Masters and students gathered to read the texts of other masters, now long dead, and<br>
the living words of the dead masters gave new perspective to the fallacies of the present<br>
day. The university was then a community of academic quest and endemic unrest.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In the modem multiversity this community has fled to the fringes, where it meets in a<br>
pad, a professor's office, or the chaplain's quarters. The structural purpose of the modem<br>
university has little to do with the traditional quest. Since Gutenberg, the exchange of<br>
disciplined, critical inquiry has, for the most part, moved from the "chair" into print. The<br>
modern university has forfeited its chance to provide a simple setting for encounters<br>
which are both autonomous and anarchic, focused yet unplanned and ebullient, and has<br>
chosen instead to manage the process by which so-called research and instruction are<br>
produced.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The American university, since Sputnik, has been trying to catch up with the body count<br>
of Soviet graduates. Now the Germans are abandoning their academic tradition and are<br>
building "campuses" in order to catch up with the Americans. During the present decade<br>
they want to increase their expenditure for grammar and high schools from 14 to 59<br>
billion DM, and more than triple expenditures for higher learning. The French propose by<br>
1980 to raise to 10 percent of their GNP the amount spent on schools, and the Ford<br>
Foundation has been pushing poor countries in Latin America to raise per capita expenses<br>
for "respect-able" graduates toward North American levels. Students see their studies as<br>
the investment with the highest monetary return, and nations see them as a key factor in<br>
development.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">For the majority who primarily seek a college degree, the university has lost no prestige,<br>
but since 1968 it has visibly lost standing among its believers. Students refuse to prepare<br>
for war, pollution, and the perpetuation of prejudice. Teachers assist them in their<br>
challenge to the legitimacy of the government, its foreign policy, education, and the<br>
American way of life. More than a few reject degrees and prepare for a life in a<br>
counterculture, outside the certified society. They seem to choose the way of medieval<br>
Fraticelli and Alumbrados of the Reformation, the hippies and dropouts of their day.<br>
Others recognize the monopoly of the schools over the resources which they need to<br>
build a countersociety. They seek support from each other to live with integrity while<br>
submitting to the academic ritual. They form, so to speak, hotbeds of heresy right within<br>
the hierarchy.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Large parts of the general population, however, regard the modern mystic and the modem<br>
heresiarch with alarm. They threaten the consumer economy, democratic privilege, and<br>
the self-image of America. But they cannot be wished away. Fewer and fewer can be</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 27</p></div><div><p dir="auto">reconverted by patience or coopted by subtlety for instance, by appointing them to teach<br>
their heresy. Hence the search for means which would make it possible either to get rid of<br>
dissident individuals or to reduce the importance of the university which serves them as a<br>
base for protest.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The students and faculty who question the legitimacy of the university, and do so at high<br>
personal cost, certainly do not feel that they are setting consumer standards or abetting a<br>
production system. Those who have founded such groups as the Committee of Concerned<br>
Asian Scholars and the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) have been<br>
among the most effective in changing radically the perceptions of the realities of foreign<br>
countries for millions of young people. Still others have tried to formulate Marxian<br>
interpretations of American society or have been among those responsible for the<br>
flowering of communes. Their achievements add new strength to the argument that the<br>
existence of the university is necessary to guarantee continued social criticism.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">There is no question that at present the university offers a unique combination of<br>
circumstances which allows some of its members to criticize the whole of society. It<br>
provides time, mobility, access to peers and information, and a certain impunity-<br>
privileges not equally available to other segments of the population. But the university<br>
provides this freedom only to those who have already been deeply initiated into the<br>
consumer society and into the need for some kind of obligatory public schooling.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The school system today performs the threefold function common to powerful churches<br>
throughout history. It is simultaneously the repository of society's myth, the<br>
institutionalization of that myth's contradictions, and the locus of the ritual which<br>
reproduces and veils the disparities between myth and reality. Today the school system,<br>
and especially the university, provides ample opportunity for criticism of the myth and<br>
for rebellion against its institutional perversions. But the ritual which demands tolerance<br>
of the fundamental contradictions between myth and institution still goes largely<br>
unchallenged, for neither ideological criticism nor social action can bring about a new<br>
society. Only disenchantment with and detachment from the central social ritual and<br>
reform of that ritual can bring about radical change.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The American university has become the final stage of the most all encompassing<br>
initiation rite the world has ever known. No society in history has been able to survive<br>
without ritual or myth, but ours is the first which has needed such a dull, protracted,<br>
destructive, and expensive initiation into its myth. The contemporary world civilization is<br>
also the first one which has found it necessary to rationalize its fundamental initiation<br>
ritual in the name of education. We cannot begin a reform of education unless we first<br>
understand that neither individual learning nor social equality can be enhanced by the<br>
ritual of schooling. We cannot go beyond the consumer society unless we first understand<br>
that obligatory public schools inevitably reproduce such a society, no matter what is<br>
taught in them.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The project of demythologizing which I propose cannot be limited to the university alone.<br>
Any attempt to reform the university without attending to the system of which it is an</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 28</p></div><div><p dir="auto">integral part is like trying to do urban renewal in New York City from the twelfth story<br>
up. Most current college-level reform looks like the building of high-rise slums. Only a<br>
generation which grows up without obligatory schools will be able to recreate the<br>
university.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Myth of Institutionalized Values</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School initiates, too, the Myth of Unending Consumption. This modem myth is<br>
grounded in the belief that process inevitably produces something of value and, therefore,<br>
production necessarily produces demand. School teaches us that instruction produces<br>
learning. The existence of schools produces the demand for schooling. Once we have<br>
learned to need school, all our activities tend to take the shape of client relationships to<br>
other specialized institutions. Once the self-taught man or woman has been discredited,<br>
all nonprofessional activity is rendered suspect. In school we are taught that valuable<br>
learning is the result of attendance; that the value of learning increases with the amount<br>
of input; and, finally, that this value can be measured and documented by grades and<br>
certificates.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In fact, learning is the human activity which least needs manipulation by others. Most<br>
learning is not the result of instruction. It is rather the result of unhampered participation<br>
in a meaningful setting. Most people learn best by being "with it," yet school makes them<br>
identify their personal, cognitive growth with elaborate planning and manipulation.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Once a man or woman has accepted the need for school, he or she is easy prey for other<br>
institutions. Once young people have allowed their imaginations to be formed by<br>
curricular instruction, they are conditioned to institutional planning of every sort.<br>
"Instruction" smothers the horizon of their imaginations. They cannot be betrayed, but<br>
only short-changed, because they have been taught to substitute expectations for hope.<br>
They will no longer be surprised, for good or ill, by other people, because they have been<br>
taught what to expect from every other person who has been taught as they were. This is<br>
true in the case of another person or in the case of a machine.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">This transfer of responsibility from self to institution guarantees social regression,<br>
especially once it has been accepted as an obligation. So rebels against Alma Mater often<br>
"make it" into her faculty instead of growing into the courage to infect others with their<br>
personal teaching and to assume responsibility for the results. This suggests the<br>
possibility of a new Oedipus story-Oedipus the Teacher, who "makes" his mother in<br>
order to engender children with her. The man addicted to being taught seeks his security<br>
in compulsive teaching. The woman who experiences her knowledge as the result of a<br>
process wants to reproduce it in others.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Myth of Measurement of Values</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The institutionalized values school instills are quantified ones. School initiates young<br>
people into a world where everything can be measured, including their imaginations, and,<br>
indeed, man himself.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 29</p></div><div><p dir="auto">But personal growth is not a measurable entity. It is growth in disciplined dissidence,<br>
which cannot be measured against any rod, or any curriculum, nor compared to someone<br>
else's achievement. In such learning one can emulate others only in imaginative<br>
endeavor, and follow in their footsteps rather than mimic their gait. The learning I prize is<br>
immeasurable re-creation.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School pretends to break learning up into subject "matters," to build into the pupil a<br>
curriculum made of these prefabricated blocks, and to gauge the result on an international<br>
scale. People who submit to the standard of others for the measure of their own personal<br>
growth soon apply the same ruler to themselves. They no longer have to be put in their<br>
place, but put themselves into their assigned slots, squeeze themselves into the niche<br>
which they have been taught to seek, and, in the very process, put their fellows into their<br>
places, too, until everybody and everything fits.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">People who have been schooled down to size let unmeasured experience slip out of their<br>
hands. To them, what cannot be measured becomes secondary, threatening. They do not<br>
have to be robbed of their creativity. Under instruction, they have unlearned to "do" their<br>
thing or "be" themselves, and value only what has been made or could be made.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Once people have the idea schooled into them that values can be produced and measured,<br>
they tend to accept all kinds of rank' ings. There is a scale for the development of nations,<br>
another for the intelligence of babies, and even progress toward peace can be calculated<br>
according to body count. In a schooled world the road to happiness is paved with a<br>
consumer's index.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Myth of Packaging Values</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School sells curriculum— a bundle of goods made according to the same process and<br>
having the same structure as other merchandise. Curriculum production for most schools<br>
begins with allegedly scientific research, on whose basis educational engineers predict<br>
future demand and tools for the assembly line, within the limits set by budgets and<br>
taboos. The distributor-teacher delivers the finished product to the consumer pupil, whose<br>
reactions are carefully studied and charted to provide research data for the preparation of<br>
the next model, which may be "ungraded," "student-designed," "team-taught," "visually-<br>
aided," or "issue-centered."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The result of the curriculum production process looks like any other modern staple. It is a<br>
bundle of planned meanings, a package of values, a commodity whose "balanced appeal"<br>
makes it marketable to a sufficiently large number to justify the cost of production.<br>
Consumer-pupils are taught to make their desires conform to marketable values. Thus<br>
they are made to feel guilty if they do not behave according to the predictions of<br>
consumer research by getting the grades and certificates that will place them in the job<br>
category they have been led to expect.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Educators can justify more expensive curricula on the basis of their observation that<br>
learning difficulties rise proportionately with the cost of the curriculum. This is an</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 30</p></div><div><p dir="auto">application of Parkinson's Law that work expands with the resources available to do it.<br>
This law can be verified on all levels of school: for instance, reading difficulties have<br>
been a major issue in French schools only since their per capita expenditures have<br>
approached U.S. levels of 1950-when reading difficulties became a major issue in U.S.<br>
schools.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In fact, healthy students often redouble their resistance to teaching as they find<br>
themselves more comprehensively manipulated. This resistance is due not to the<br>
authoritarian style of a public school or the seductive style of some free schools, but to<br>
the fundamental approach common to all schools-the idea that one person's judgment<br>
should determine what and when another person must learn.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Myth of Self-Perpetuating Progress</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Even when accompanied by declining returns in learning, paradoxically, rising per capita<br>
instructional costs increase the value of the pupil in his or her own eyes and on the<br>
market. At almost any cost, school pushes the pupil up to the level of competitive<br>
curricular consumption, into progress to ever higher levels. Expenditures to motivate the<br>
student to stay on in school skyrocket as he climbs the pyramid. On higher levels they are<br>
disguised as new football stadiums, chapels, or programs called International Education.<br>
If it teaches nothing else, school teaches the value of escalation: the value of the<br>
American way of doing things.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Vietnam war fits the logic of the moment. Its success has been measured by the<br>
numbers of persons effectively treated by cheap bullets delivered at immense cost, and<br>
this brutal calculus is unashamedly called "body count." Just as business is business, the<br>
never-ending accumulation of money, so war is killing, the never-ending accumulation of<br>
dead bodies. In like manner, education is schooling, and this open-ended process is<br>
counted in pupil-hours. The various processes are irreversible and self-justifying. By<br>
economic standards the country gets richer and richer. By death-accounting standards the<br>
nation goes on winning its war forever. And by school standards the population becomes<br>
increasingly educated.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School programs hunger for progressive intake of instruction, but even if the hunger leads<br>
to steady absorption, it never yields the joy of knowing something to one's satisfaction.<br>
Each subject comes packaged with the instruction to go on consuming one "offering"<br>
after another, and last year's wrapping is always obsolete for this year's consumer. The<br>
textbook racket builds on this demand. Educational reformers promise each new<br>
generation the latest and the best, and the public is schooled into demanding what they<br>
offer. Both the dropout who is forever reminded of what he missed and the graduate who<br>
is made to feel inferior to the new breed of student know exactly where they stand in the<br>
ritual of rising deceptions and continue to support a society which euphemistically calls<br>
the widening frustration gap a "revolution of rising expectations."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page #31</p></div><div><p dir="auto">But growth conceived as open-ended consumption-eternal progress-can never lead to<br>
maturity. Commitment to unlimited quantitative increase vitiates the possibility of<br>
organic development.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Ritual Game and the New World Religion</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The school leaving age in developed nations outpaces the rise in life expectancy. The<br>
two curves will intersect in a decade and create a problem for Jessica Mitford and<br>
professionals concerned with "terminal education." I am reminded of the late Middle<br>
Ages, when the demand for Church services outgrew a lifetime, and "Purgatory" was<br>
created to purify souls under the pope's control before they could enter eternal peace.<br>
Logically, this led first to a trade in indulgences and then to an attempt at Reformation.<br>
The Myth of Unending Consumption now takes the place of belief in life everlasting.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Arnold Toynbee has pointed out that the decadence of a great culture is usually<br>
accompanied by the rise of a new World Church which extends hope to the domestic<br>
proletariat while serving the needs of a new warrior class. School seems eminently suited<br>
to be the World Church of our decaying culture. No institution could better veil from its<br>
participants the deep discrepancy between social principles and social reality in today's<br>
world. Secular, scientific, and death-denying, it is of a piece with the modern mood. Its<br>
classical, critical veneer makes it appear pluralist if not antireligious. Its curriculum both<br>
defines science and is itself defined by so-called scientific research. No one completes<br>
school— yet. It never closes its doors on anyone without first offering him one more<br>
chance: at remedial, adult, and continuing education.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School serves as an effective creator and sustainer of social myth because of its structure<br>
as a ritual game of graded promotions. Introduction into this gambling ritual is much<br>
more important than what or how something is taught. It is the game itself that schools,<br>
that gets into the blood and becomes a habit. A whole society is initiated into the Myth of<br>
Unending Consumption of services. This happens to the degree that token participation in<br>
the open-ended ritual is made compulsory and compulsive everywhere. School directs<br>
ritual rivalry into an international game which obliges competitors to blame the world's<br>
ills on those who cannot or will not play. School is a ritual of initiation which introduces<br>
the neophyte to the sacred race of progressive consumption, a ritual of propitiation whose<br>
academic priests mediate between the faithful and the gods of privilege and power, a<br>
ritual of expiation which sacrifices its dropouts, branding them as scapegoats of<br>
underdevelopment .</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Even those who spend at best a few years in school-and this is the overwhelming<br>
majority in Latin America, Asia, and Africa-leam to feel guilty because of their<br>
underconsumption of schooling. In Mexico six grades of school are legally obligatory.<br>
Children bom into the lower economic third have only two chances in three to make it<br>
into the first grade. If they make it, they have four chances in one hundred to finish<br>
obligatory schooling by the sixth grade. If they are born into the middle third group, their<br>
chances increase to twelve out of a hundred. With these rules, Mexico is more successful</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 32</p></div><div><p dir="auto">than most of the other twenty-five Latin American republics in providing public<br>
education.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Everywhere, all children know that they were given a chance, albeit an unequal one, in an<br>
obligatory lottery, and the presumed equality of the international standard now<br>
compounds their original poverty with the self-inflicted discrimination accepted by the<br>
dropout. They have been schooled to the belief in rising expectations and can now<br>
rationalize their growing frustration outside school by accepting their rejection from<br>
scholastic grace. They are excluded from Heaven because, once baptized, they did not go<br>
to church. Bom in original sin, they are baptized into first grade, but go to Gehenna<br>
(which in Hebrew means "slum") because of their personal faults. As Max Weber traced<br>
the social effects of the belief that salvation belonged to those who accumulated wealth,<br>
we can now observe that grace is reserved for those who accumulate years in school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Coming Kingdom: The Universalization of Expectations</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School combines the expectations of the consumer expressed in its claims with the<br>
beliefs of the producer expressed in its ritual, It is a liturgical expression of a world- wide<br>
"cargo cult," reminiscent of the cults which swept Melanesia in the forties, which injected<br>
cultists with the belief that if they but put on a black tie over their naked torsos, Jesus<br>
would arrive in a steamer bearing an icebox, a pair of trousers, and a sewing machine for<br>
each believer.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School fuses the growth in humiliating dependence on a master with the growth in the<br>
futile sense of omnipotence that is so typical of the pupil who wants to go out and teach<br>
all nations to save themselves. The ritual is tailored to the stern work habits of the<br>
hardhats, and its purpose is to celebrate the myth of an earthly paradise of never-ending<br>
consumption, which is the only hope for the wretched and dispossessed.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Epidemics of insatiable this-worldly expectations have occurred throughout history,<br>
especially among colonized and marginal groups in all cultures. Jews in the Roman<br>
Empire had their Essenes and Jewish messiahs, serfs in the Reformation their Thomas<br>
MYnzer, dispossessed Indians from Paraguay to Dakota their infectious dancers. These<br>
sects were always led by a prophet, and limited their promises to a chosen few. The<br>
school-induced expectation of the kingdom, on the other hand, is impersonal rather than<br>
prophetic, and universal rather than local. Man has become the engineer of his own<br>
messiah and promises the unlimited rewards of science to those who submit to<br>
progressive engineering for his reign.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The New Alienation</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School is not only the New World Religion. It is also the world's fastest-growing labor<br>
market. The engineering of consumers has become the economy's principal growth<br>
sector. As production costs decrease in rich nations, there is an increasing concentration<br>
of both capital and labor in the vast enterprise of equipping man for disciplined<br>
consumption. During the past decade capital investments directly related to the school</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 33</p></div><div><p dir="auto">system rose even faster than expenditures for defense. Disarmament would only<br>
accelerate the process by which the learning industry moves to the center of the national<br>
economy. School gives unlimited opportunity for legitimated waste, so long as its<br>
destructiveness goes unrecognized and the cost of palliatives goes up.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">If we add those engaged in full-time teaching to those in full-time attendance, we realize<br>
that this so-called superstructure has become society's major employer. In the United<br>
States sixty-two million people are in school and eighty million at work elsewhere. This<br>
is often forgotten by neo-Marxist analysts who say that the process of deschooling must<br>
be postponed or bracketed until other disorders, traditionally understood as more<br>
fundamental, are corrected by an economic and political revolution. Only if school is<br>
understood as an industry can revolutionary strategy be planned realistically. For Marx,<br>
the cost of producing demands for commodities was barely significant. Today most<br>
human labor is engaged in the production of demands that can be satisfied by industry<br>
which makes intensive use of capital. Most of this is done in school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Alienation, in the traditional scheme, was a direct consequence of work's becoming<br>
wage-labor which deprived man of the opportunity to create and be recreated. Now<br>
young people are prealienated by schools that isolate them while they pretend to be both<br>
producers and consumers of their own knowledge, which is conceived of as a commodity<br>
put on the market in school. School makes alienation preparatory to life, thus depriving<br>
education of reality and work of creativity. School prepares for the alienating<br>
institutionalization of life by teaching the need to be taught. Once this lesson is learned,<br>
people lose their incentive to grow in independence; they no longer find relatedness<br>
attractive, and close themselves off to the surprises which life offers when it is not<br>
predetermined by institutional definition. And school directly or indirectly employs a<br>
major portion of the population. School either keeps people for life or makes sure that<br>
they will fit into some institution.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The New World Church is the knowledge industry, both purveyor of opium and the<br>
workbench during an increasing number of the years of an individual's life. Deschooling<br>
is, therefore, at the root of any movement for human liberation.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Revolutionary Potential of Deschooling</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Of course, school is not, by any means, the only modern institution which has as its<br>
primary purpose the shaping of man's vision of reality. The hidden curriculum of family<br>
life, draft, health care, so-called professionalism, or of the media play an important part in<br>
the institutional manipulation of man's world-vision, language, and demands. But school<br>
enslaves more profoundly and more systematically, since only school is credited with the<br>
principal function of forming critical judgment, and, paradoxically, tries to do so by<br>
making learning about oneself, about others, and about nature depend on a prepackaged<br>
process. School touches us so intimately that none of us can expect to be liberated from it<br>
by something else.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 34</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Many self-styled revolutionaries are victims of school. They see even "liberation" as the<br>
product of an institutional process. Only liberating oneself from school will dispel such<br>
illusions. The discovery that most learning requires no teaching can be neither<br>
manipulated nor planned. Each of us is personally responsible for his or her own<br>
deschooling, and only we have the power to do it. No one can be excused if he fails to<br>
liberate himself from schooling. People could not free themselves from the Crown until at<br>
least some of them had freed themselves from the established Church. They cannot free<br>
themselves from progressive consumption until they free themselves from obligatory<br>
school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">We are all involved in schooling, from both the side of production and that of<br>
consumption. We are superstitiously convinced that good learning can and should be<br>
produced in us-and that we can produce it in others. Our attempt to withdraw from the<br>
concept of school will reveal the resistance we find in ourselves when we try to renounce<br>
limitless consumption and the pervasive presumption that others can be manipulated for<br>
their own good. No one is fully exempt from the exploitation of others in the schooling<br>
process.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School is both the largest and the most anonymous employer of all. Indeed, the school is<br>
the best example of a new kind of enterprise, succeeding the guild, the factory, and the<br>
corporation. The multinational corporations which have dominated the economy are now<br>
being complemented, and may one day be replaced, by supemationally planned service<br>
agencies. These enterprises present their services in ways that make all men feel obliged<br>
to consume them. They are internationally standardized, redefining the value of their<br>
services periodically and everywhere at approximately the same rhythm.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">"Transportation" relying on new cars and superhighways serves the same institutionally<br>
packaged need for comfort, prestige, speed, and gadgetry, whether its components are<br>
produced by the state or not. The apparatus of "medical care" defines a peculiar kind of<br>
health, whether the service is paid for by the state or by the individual. Graded promotion<br>
in order to obtain diplomas fits the student for a place on the same international pyramid<br>
of qualified manpower, no matter who directs the school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In all these cases employment is a hidden benefit: the driver of a private automobile, the<br>
patient who submits to hospitalization, or the pupil in the schoolroom must now be seen<br>
as part of a new class of "employees." A liberation movement which starts in school, and<br>
yet is grounded in the awareness of teachers and pupils as simultaneously exploiters and<br>
exploited, could foreshadow the revolutionary strategies of the future; for a radical<br>
program of deschooling could train youth in the new style of revolution needed to<br>
challenge a social system featuring obligatory "health," "wealth," and "security."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The risks of a revolt against school are unforeseeable, but they are not as horrible as those<br>
of a revolution starting in any other major institution. School is not yet organized for self-<br>
protection as effectively as a nation-state, or even a large corporation. Liberation from the<br>
grip of schools could be bloodless. The weapons of the truant officer and his allies in the<br>
courts and employment agencies might take very cruel measures against the individual</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 35</p></div><div><p dir="auto">offender, especially if he or she were poor, but they might turn out to be powerless<br>
against the surge of a mass movement.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School has become a social problem; it is being attacked on all sides, and citizens and<br>
their governments sponsor unconventional experiments all over the world. They resort to<br>
unusual statistical devices in order to keep faith and save face. The mood among some<br>
educators is much like the mood among Catholic bishops after the Vatican Council. The<br>
curricula of so-called "free schools" resemble the liturgies of folk and rock masses. The<br>
demands of high-school students to have a say in choosing their teachers are as strident as<br>
those of parishioners demanding to select their pastors. But the stakes for society are<br>
much higher if a significant minority loses its faith in schooling. This would endanger the<br>
survival not only of the economic order built on the coproduction of goods and demands,<br>
but equally of the political order built on the nation-state into which students are<br>
delivered by the school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Our options are clear enough. Either we continue to believe that institutionalized learning<br>
is a product which justifies unlimited investment or we rediscover that legislation and<br>
planning and investment, if they have any place in formal education, should be used<br>
mostly to tear down the barriers that now impede opportunities for learning, which can<br>
only be a personal activity.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">If we do not challenge the assumption that valuable knowledge is a commodity which<br>
under certain circumstances may be forced into the consumer, society will be<br>
increasingly dominated by sinister pseudo schools and totalitarian managers of<br>
information. Pedagogical therapists will drug their pupils more in order to teach them<br>
better, and students will drug themselves more to gain relief from the pressures of<br>
teachers and the race for certificates. Increasingly larger numbers of bureaucrats will<br>
presume to pose as teachers. The language of the schoolman has already been coopted by<br>
the adman. Now the general and the policeman try to dignify their professions by<br>
masquerading as educators. In a schooled society, warmaking and civil repression find an<br>
educational rationale. Pedagogical warfare in the style of Vietnam will be increasingly<br>
justified as the only way of teaching people the superior value of unending progress.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Repression will be seen as a missionary effort to hasten the coming of the mechanical<br>
Messiah. More and more countries will resort to the pedagogical torture already<br>
implemented in Brazil and Greece. This pedagogical torture is not used to extract<br>
information or to satisfy the psychic needs of sadists. It relies on random terror to break<br>
the integrity of an entire population and make it plastic material for the teachings<br>
invented by technocrats. The totally destructive and constantly progressive nature of<br>
obligatory instruction will fulfill its ultimate logic unless we begin to liberate ourselves<br>
right now from our pedagogical hubris, our belief that man can do what God cannot,<br>
namely, manipulate others for their own salvation.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Many people are just awakening to the inexorable destruction which present production<br>
trends imply for the environment, but individuals have only very limited power to change<br>
these trends. The manipulation of men and women begun in school has also reached a</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 36</p></div><div><p dir="auto">point of no return, and most people are still unaware of it. They still encourage school<br>
reform, as Henry Ford II proposes less poisonous automobiles.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Daniel Bell says that our epoch is characterized by an extreme disjunction between<br>
cultural and social structures, the one being devoted to apocalyptic attitudes, the other to<br>
technocratic decision-making. This is certainly true for many educational reformers, who<br>
feel impelled to condemn almost everything which characterizes modern schools-and at<br>
the same time propose new schools.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn argues that such dissonance<br>
inevitably precedes the emergence of a new cognitive paradigm. The facts reported by<br>
those who observed free fall, by those who returned from the other side of the earth, and<br>
by those who used the new telescope did not fit the Ptolemaic world view. Quite<br>
suddenly, the Newtonian paradigm was accepted. The dissonance which characterizes<br>
many of the young today is not so much cognitive as a matter of attitudes— a feeling about<br>
what a tolerable society cannot be like. What is surprising about this dissonance is the<br>
ability of a very large number of people to tolerate it.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The capacity to pursue incongruous goals requires an explanation. According to Max<br>
Gluckman, all societies have procedures to hide such dissonances from their members.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">He suggests that this is the purpose of ritual. Rituals can hide from their participants even<br>
discrepancies and conflicts between social principle and social organization. As long as<br>
an individual is not explicitly conscious of the ritual character of the process through<br>
which he was initiated to the forces which shape his cosmos, he cannot break the spell<br>
and shape a new cosmos. As long as we are not aware of the ritual through which school<br>
shapes the progressive consumer— the economy's major resource— we cannot break the<br>
spell of this economy and shape a new one.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 37</p></div><div><p dir="auto">4</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Institutional Spectrum</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Most utopian schemes and futuristic scenarios call for new and costly technologies,<br>
which would have to be sold to rich and poor nations alike. Herman Kahn has found<br>
pupils in Venezuela, Argentina, and Colombia. The pipe dreams of Sergio Bernardes for<br>
his Brazil of the year 2000 sparkle with more new machinery than is now possessed by<br>
the United States, which by then will be weighted down with the antiquated missile sites,<br>
jetports, and cities of the sixties and seventies. Futurists inspired by Buckminster Fuller<br>
would depend on cheaper and more exotic devices. They count on the acceptance of a<br>
new but possible technology that would apparently allow us to make more with less-<br>
lightweight monorails rather than supersonic transport; vertical living rather than<br>
horizontal sprawling. All of today's futuristic planners seek to make economically<br>
feasible what is technically possible while refusing to face the inevitable social<br>
consequence: the increased craving of all men for goods and services that will remain the<br>
privilege of a few.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I believe that a desirable future depends on our deliberately choosing a life of action over<br>
a life of consumption, on our engendering a life style which will enable us to be<br>
spontaneous, independent, yet related to each other, rather than maintaining a life style<br>
which only allows us to make and unmake, produce and consume-a style of life which is<br>
merely a way station on the road to the depletion and pollution of the environment. The<br>
future depends more upon our choice of institutions which support a life of action than on<br>
our developing new ideologies and technologies. We need a set of criteria which will<br>
permit us to recognize those institutions which support personal growth rather than<br>
addiction, as well as the will to invest our techno-logical resources preferentially in such<br>
institutions of growth.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The choice is between two radically opposed institutional types, both of which are<br>
exemplified in certain existing institutions, although one type so characterizes the<br>
contemporary period, as to almost define it. This dominant type I would propose to call<br>
the manipulative institution. The other type also exists, but only precariously. The<br>
institutions which fit it are humbler and less noticeable; yet I take them as models for a<br>
more desirable future. I call them "convivial" and suggest placing them at the left of an<br>
institutional spectrum, both to show that there are institutions which fall between the</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 38</p></div><div><p dir="auto">extremes and to illustrate how historical institutions can change color as they shift from<br>
facilitating activity to organizing production.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Generally, such a spectrum, moving from left to right, has been used to characterize men<br>
and their ideologies, not our social institutions and their styles. This categorization of<br>
men, whether as individuals or in groups, often generates more heat than light. Weighty<br>
objections can be raised against using an ordinary convention in an unusual fashion, but<br>
by doing so I hope to shift the terms of the discussion from a sterile to a fertile plane. It<br>
will become evident that men of the left are not always characterized by their opposition<br>
to the manipulative institutions, which I locate to the right on the spectrum.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The most influential modern institutions crowd up at the right of the spectrum. Law<br>
enforcement has moved there, as it has shifted from the hands of the sheriff to those of<br>
the FBI and the Pentagon. Modern warfare has become a highly professional enterprise<br>
whose business is killing. It has reached the point where its efficiency is measured in<br>
body counts. Its peace-keeping potential depends on its ability to convince friend and foe<br>
of the nation's unlimited death-dealing power. Modern bullets and chemicals are so<br>
effective that a few cents' worth, properly delivered to the intended "client," unfailingly<br>
kill or maim. But delivery costs rise vertiginously; the cost of a dead Vietnamese went<br>
from $360,000 in 1967 to $450,000 in 1969. Only economies on a scale approaching race<br>
suicide would render modem warfare economically efficient. The boomerang effect in<br>
war is becoming more obvious: the higher the body count of dead Vietnamese, the more<br>
enemies the United States acquires around the world; likewise, the more the United States<br>
must spend to create another manipulative institution— cynically dubbed "pacification" in<br>
a futile effort to absorb the side effects of war.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At this same extreme on the spectrum we also find social agencies which specialize in the<br>
manipulation of their clients. Like the military, they tend to develop effects contrary to<br>
their aims as the scope of their operations increases. These social institutions are equally<br>
counterproductive, but less obviously so. Many assume a therapeutic and compassionate<br>
image to mask this paradoxical effect. For example, jails, up until two centuries ago,<br>
served as a means of detaining men until they were sentenced, maimed, killed, or exiled,<br>
and were sometimes deliberately used as a form of torture. Only recently have we begun<br>
to claim that locking people up in cages will have a beneficial effect on their character<br>
and behavior. Now quite a few people are beginning to understand that jail increases both<br>
the quality and the quantity of criminals, that, in fact, it often creates them out of mere<br>
nonconformists. Far fewer people, however, seem to understand that mental hospitals,<br>
nursing homes, and orphan asylums do much the same thing. These institutions provide<br>
their clients with the destructive self-image of the psychotic, the overaged, or the waif,<br>
and provide a rationale for the existence of entire professions, just as jails produce<br>
income for wardens. Membership in the institutions found at this extreme of the spectrum<br>
is achieved in two ways, both coercive: by forced commitment or by selective service.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At the opposite extreme of the spectrum lie institutions distinguished by spontaneous use-<br>
the "convivial" institutions. Telephone link-ups, subway lines, mail routes, public<br>
markets and exchanges do not require hard or soft sells to induce their clients to use</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 39</p></div><div><p dir="auto">them. Sewage systems, drinking water, parks, and side-walks are institutions men use<br>
without having to be institutionally convinced that it is to their advantage to do so. Of<br>
course, all institutions require some regulation. But the opera, tion of institutions which<br>
exist to be used rather than to produce something requires rules of an entirely different<br>
nature from those required by treatment-institutions, which are manipulative. The rules<br>
which govern institutions for use have mainly the purpose of avoiding abuses which<br>
would frustrate their general accessibility. Sidewalks must be kept free of obstructions,<br>
the industrial use of drinking water must be held within limits, and ball playing must be<br>
restricted to special areas within a park. At present we need legislation to limit the abuse<br>
of our telephone lines by computers, the abuse of mail service by advertisers, and the<br>
pollution of our sewage systems by industrial wastes. The regulation of convivial<br>
institutions sets limits to their use; as one moves from the convivial to the manipulative<br>
end of the spectrum, the rules progressively call for unwilling consumption or<br>
participation. The different cost of acquiring clients is just one of the characteristics<br>
which distinguish convivial from manipulative institutions.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At both extremes of the spectrum we find service institutions, but on the right the service<br>
is imposed manipulation, and the client is made the victim of advertising, aggression,<br>
indoctrination, imprisonment, or electroshock. On the left the service is amplified<br>
opportunity within formally defined limits, while the client remains a free agent. Right-<br>
wing institutions tend to be highly complex and costly production processes in which<br>
much of the elaboration and expense is concerned with convincing consumers that they<br>
cannot live without the product or the treatment offered by the institution. Left-wing<br>
institutions tend to be networks which facilitate client-initiated communication or<br>
cooperation.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The manipulative institutions of the right are either socially or psychologically<br>
"addictive." Social addiction, or escalation, consists in the tendency to prescribe<br>
increased treatment if smaller quantities have not yielded the desired results. Psycho-<br>
logical addiction, or habituation, results when consumers become hooked on the need for<br>
more and more of the process or product. The self-activated institutions of the left tend to<br>
be self-limiting. Unlike production processes which identify satisfaction with the mere<br>
act of consumption, these networks serve a purpose beyond their own repeated use. An<br>
individual picks up the telephone when he wants to say something to someone else, and<br>
hangs up when the desired communication is over. He does not, teen-agers excepted, use<br>
the telephone for the sheer pleasure of talking into the receiver. If the telephone is not the<br>
best way to get in touch, people will write a letter or take a trip. Right-wing institutions,<br>
as we can see clearly in the case of schools, both invite compulsively repetitive use and<br>
frustrate alternative ways of achieving similar results.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Toward, but not at, the left on the institutional spectrum, we can locate enterprises which<br>
compete with others in their own field, but have not begun notably to engage in<br>
advertising. Here we find hand laundries, small bakeries, hairdressers, and-to speak of<br>
professionals-some lawyers and music teachers. Characteristically left of center, then, are<br>
self-employed persons who have institutionalized their services but not their publicity.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 40</p></div><div><p dir="auto">They acquire clients through their personal touch and the comparative quality of their<br>
services.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Hotels and cafeterias are somewhat closer to the center. The big chains like Hilton-which<br>
spend huge amounts on selling their image-often behave as if they were running<br>
institutions of the right. Yet Hilton and Sheraton enterprises do not usually offer anything<br>
more-in fact, they often give less-than similarly priced, independently managed lodgings.<br>
Essentially, a hotel sign beckons to a traveler in the manner of a road sign. It says, "Stop,<br>
here is a bed for you," rather than, "You should prefer a hotel bed to a park bench!"</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The producers of staples and most perishable consumer goods belong in the middle of our<br>
spectrum. They fill generic demands and add to the cost of production and distribution<br>
whatever the market will bear in advertising costs for publicity and special packaging.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The more basic the product-be it goods or services-the more does competition tend to<br>
limit the sales cost of the item.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Most manufacturers of consumer goods have moved much further to the right. Both<br>
directly and indirectly, they produce demands for accessories which boost real purchase<br>
price far beyond production cost. General Motors and Ford produce means of<br>
transportation, but they also, and more importantly, manipulate public taste in such a way<br>
that the need for transportation is expressed as a demand for private cars rather than<br>
public buses. They sell the desire to control a machine, to race at high speeds in luxurious<br>
comfort, while also offering the fantasy at the end of the road. What they sell, however, is<br>
not just a matter of uselessly big motors, superfluous gadgetry, or the new extras forced<br>
on the manufacturers by Ralph Nader and the clean-air lobbyists. The list price includes<br>
souped-up engines, air-conditioning, safety belts, and exhaust controls; but other costs<br>
not openly declared to the driver are also involved: the corporation's advertising and sales<br>
expenses, fuel, maintenance and parts, insurance, interest on credit, as well as less<br>
tangible costs like loss of time, temper, and breathable air in our traffic-congested cities.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">An especially interesting corollary to our discussion of socially useful institutions is the<br>
system of "public" highways. This major element of the total cost of automobiles<br>
deserves lengthier treatment, since it leads directly to the rightist institution in which I am<br>
most interested, namely, the school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">False Public Utilities</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The highway system is a network for locomotion across relatively large distances. As a<br>
network, it appears to belong on the left of the institutional spectrum. But here we must<br>
make a distinction which will clarify both the nature of highways and the nature of true<br>
public utilities. Genuinely all-purpose roads are true public utilities. Superhighways are<br>
private preserves, the cost of which has been partially foisted upon the public.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Telephone, postal, and highway systems are all networks, and none of them is free.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Access to the telephone network is limited by time charges on each call. These rates are<br>
relatively small and could be reduced without changing the nature of the system. Use of</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page #41</p></div><div><p dir="auto">the telephone system is not in the least limited by what is transmitted, although it is best<br>
used by those who can speak coherent sentences in the language of the other party-an<br>
ability universally possessed by those who wish to use the network. Postage is usually<br>
cheap. Use of the postal system is slightly limited by the price of pen and paper, and<br>
somewhat more by the ability to write. Still, when someone who does not know how to<br>
write has a relative or friend to whom he can dictate a letter, the postal system is at his<br>
service, as it is if he wants to ship a recorded tape.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The highway system does not similarly become available to someone who merely learns<br>
to drive. The telephone and postal networks exist to serve those who wish to use them,<br>
while the highway system mainly serves as an accessory to the private automobile. The<br>
former are true public utilities, whereas the latter is a public service to the owners of cars,<br>
trucks, and buses. Public utilities exist for the sake of communication among men;<br>
highways, like other institutions of the right, exist for the sake of a product. Auto<br>
manufacturers, we have already observed, produce simultaneously both cars and the<br>
demand for cars. They also produce the demand for multilane highways, bridges, and<br>
oilfields. The private car is the focus of a cluster of right-wing institutions. The high cost<br>
of each element is dictated by elaboration of the basic product, and to sell the basic<br>
product is to hook society on the entire package.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To plan a highway system as a true public utility would discriminate against those for<br>
whom velocity and individualized comfort are the primary transportation values, in favor<br>
of those who value fluidity and destination. It is the difference between a far-flung<br>
network with maximum access for travelers and one which offers only privileged access<br>
to restricted areas.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Transferring a modern institution to the developing nations provides the acid test of its<br>
quality. In very poor countries roads are usually just good enough to permit transit by<br>
special, high-axle trucks loaded with groceries, livestock, or people. This kind of country<br>
should use its limited resources to build a spiderweb of trails extending to every region<br>
and should restrict imports to two or three different models of highly durable vehicles<br>
which can manage all trails at low speed. This would simplify maintenance and the<br>
stocking of spare parts, permit the operation of these vehicles around the clock, and<br>
provide maximum fluidity and choice of destination to all citizens. This would require the<br>
engineering of all-purpose vehicles with the simplicity of the Model T, making use of the<br>
most modern alloys to guarantee durability, with a built-in speed limit of not more than<br>
fifteen miles per hour, and strong enough to run on the roughest terrain. Such vehicles are<br>
not on the market because there is no demand for them. As a matter of fact, such a<br>
demand would have to be cultivated, quite possibly under the protection of strict<br>
legislation. At present, whenever such a demand is even slightly felt, it is quickly snuffed<br>
out by counterpublicity aimed at universal sales of the machines which currently extract<br>
from U.S. taxpayers the money needed for building superhighways.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In order to "improve" transportation, all countries-even the poorest-now plan highway<br>
systems designed for the passenger cars and high-speed trailers which fit the velocity-<br>
conscious minority of producers and consumers in the elite classes. This approach is</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 42</p></div><div><p dir="auto">frequently rationalized as a saving of the most precious resource of a poor country: the<br>
time of the doctor, the school inspector, or the public administrator. These men, of<br>
course, serve almost exclusively the same people who have, or hope one day to have, a<br>
car. Local taxes and scarce international exchange are wasted on false public utilities.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">"Modem" technology transferred to poor countries falls into three large categories:<br>
goods, factories which make them, and service institutions— principally schools— which<br>
make men into modem producers and consumers. Most countries spend by far the largest<br>
proportion of their budget on schools. The school-made graduates then create a demand<br>
for other conspicuous utilities, such as industrial power, paved highways, modern<br>
hospitals, and airports, and these in turn create a market for the goods made for rich<br>
countries and, after a while, the tendency to import obsolescent factories to produce them.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Of all "false utilities," school is the most insidious. Highway systems produce only a<br>
demand for cars. Schools create a demand for the entire set of modern institutions which<br>
crowd the right end of the spectrum. A man who questioned the need for high, ways<br>
would be written off as a romantic; the man who questions the need for school is<br>
immediately attacked as either heartless or imperialist.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Schools as False Public Utilities</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Like highways, schools, at first glance, give the impression of being equally open to all<br>
comers. They are, in fact, open only to those who consistently renew their credentials.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Just as highways create the impression that their present level of cost per year is<br>
necessary if people are to move, so schools are presumed essential for attaining the<br>
competence required by a society which uses modern technology. We have exposed<br>
speedways as spurious public utilities by noting their dependence on private automobiles.<br>
Schools are based upon the equally spurious hypothesis that learning is the result of<br>
curricular teaching.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Highways result from a perversion of the desire and need for mobility into the demand<br>
for a private car. Schools themselves pervert the natural inclination to grow and learn into<br>
the demand for instruction. Demand for manufactured maturity is a far greater abnegation<br>
of self-initiated activity than the demand for manufactured goods. Schools are not only to<br>
the right of highways and cars; they belong near the extreme of the institutional spectrum<br>
occupied by total asylums. Even the producers of body counts kill only bodies. By<br>
making men abdicate the responsibility for their own growth, school leads many to a kind<br>
of spiritual suicide.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Highways are paid for in part by those who use them, since tolls and gasoline taxes are<br>
extracted only from drivers. School, on the other hand, is a perfect system of regressive<br>
taxation, where the privileged graduates ride on the back of the entire paying public.<br>
School puts a head tax on promotion. The underconsumption of highway mileage is not<br>
nearly so costly as the underconsumption of schooling. The man who does not own a car<br>
in Los Angeles may be almost immobilized, but if he can somehow manage to reach a<br>
work place, he can get and hold a job. The school dropout has no alternative route. The</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 43</p></div><div><p dir="auto">suburbanite with his new Lincoln and his country cousin who drives a beat-up jalopy get<br>
essentially the same use out of the highway, even though one man's car costs thirty times<br>
more than the other's. The value of a man's schooling is a function of the number of years<br>
he has completed and of the costliness of the schools he has attended. The law compels<br>
no one to drive, whereas it obliges everyone to go to school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The analysis of institutions according to their present placement on a left-right continuum<br>
enables me to clarify my belief that fundamental social change must begin with a change<br>
of consciousness about institutions and to explain why the dimension of a viable future<br>
turns on the rejuvenation of institutional style.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">During the sixties institutions born in different decades since the French Revolution<br>
simultaneously reached old age; public school systems founded in the time of Jefferson<br>
or of AtatYrk, along with others which started after World War II, all became<br>
bureaucratic, self-justifying, and manipulative. The same thing happened to systems of<br>
social security, to labor unions, major churches and diplomacies, the care of the aged, and<br>
the disposal of the dead.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Today, for instance, the school systems of Colombia, Britain, the U.S.S.R., and the U.S.<br>
resemble each other more closely than U.S. schools of the late 1890's resembled either<br>
today's or their contemporaries in Russia. Today all schools are obligatory, open-ended,<br>
and competitive. The same convergence in institutional style affects health care,<br>
merchandising, personnel administration, and political life. All these institutional<br>
processes tend to pile up at the manipulative end of the spectrum.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A merger of world bureaucracies results from this convergence of institutions. The style,<br>
the ranking systems, and the paraphernalia (from textbook to computer) are standardized<br>
on the planning boards of Costa Rica or Afghanistan after the model of Western Europe.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Everywhere these bureaucracies seem to focus on the same task: promoting the growth of<br>
institutions of the right. They are concerned with the making of things, the making of<br>
ritual rules, and the making-and reshaping— of "executive truth," the ideology or fiat<br>
which establishes the current value which should be attributed to their product.<br>
Technology provides these bureaucracies with increasing power on the right hand of<br>
society. The left hand of society seems to wither, not because technology is less capable<br>
of increasing the range of human action, and providing time for the play of individual<br>
imagination and personal creativity, but because such use of technology does not increase<br>
the power of an elite which administers it. The postmaster has no control over the<br>
substantive use of the mails, the switchboard operator or Bell Telephone executive has no<br>
power to stop adultery, murder, or subversion from being planned over his network.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At stake in the choice between the institutional right and left is the very nature of human<br>
life. Man must choose whether to be rich in things or in the freedom to use them. He must<br>
choose between alternate styles of life and related production schedules.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 44</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Aristotle had already discovered that "making and acting" are different, so different, in<br>
fact, that one never includes the other. "For neither is acting a way of making-nor making</p></div><div><p dir="auto">a way of truly acting. Architecture [techne] is a way of making of bringing</p></div><div><p dir="auto">something into being whose origin is in the maker and not in the thing. Making has<br>
always an end other than itself, action not; for good action itself is its end. Perfection in<br>
making is an art, perfection in acting is a virtue."<em> [</em>Nichomachean Ethics, 1 1 40.] The<br>
word which Aristotle employed for making was "poesis, " and the word he employed for<br>
doing, "praxis. " A move to the right implies that an institution is being restructured to<br>
increase its ability to "make," while as it moves to the left, it is being restructured to<br>
allow increased "doing" or "praxis. " Modern technology has increased the ability of man<br>
to relinquish the "making" of things to machines, and his potential time for "acting"" has<br>
increased. "Making" the necessities of life has ceased to take up his time. Unemployment<br>
is the result of this modernization: it is the idleness of a man for whom there is nothing to<br>
"make" and who does not know what to "do"— that is, how to "act." Unemployment is the<br>
sad idleness of a man who, contrary to Aristotle, believes that making things, or working,<br>
is virtuous and that idleness is bad. Unemployment is the experience of the man who has<br>
succumbed to the Protestant ethic. Leisure, according to Weber, is necessary for man to<br>
be able to work. For Aristotle, work is necessary for man to have leisure.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Technology provides man with discretionary time he can fill either with making or with<br>
doing. The choice between sad unemployment and joyful leisure is now open for the<br>
entire culture. It depends on the institutional style the culture chooses. This choice would<br>
have been unthinkable in an ancient culture built either on peasant agriculture or on<br>
slavery. It has become inevitable for postindustrial man.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">One way to fill available time is to stimulate increased demands for the consumption of<br>
goods and, simultaneously, for the production of services. The former implies an<br>
economy which provides an ever-growing array of ever newer things which can be made,<br>
consumed, wasted, and recycled. The latter implies the futile attempt to "make" virtuous<br>
actions into the products of "service" institutions. This leads to the identification of<br>
schooling and education, of medical service and health, of program-watching and<br>
entertainment, of speed and effective locomotion. This first option now goes under the<br>
name of development.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The radically alternative way to fill available time is a limited range of more durable<br>
goods and to provide access to institutions which can increase the opportunity and<br>
desirability of human interaction.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A durable-goods economy is precisely the contrary of an economy based on planned<br>
obsolescence. A durable-goods economy means a constraint on the bill of goods. Goods<br>
would have to be such that they provided the maximum opportunity to "do" something<br>
with them: items made for self-assembly, self-help, reuse, and repair.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The complement to a durable, repairable, and reusable bill of goods is not an increase of<br>
institutionally produced services, but rather an institutional framework which constantly<br>
educates to action, participation, and self-help. The movement of our society from the</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 45</p></div><div><p dir="auto">present— in which all institutions gravitate toward post-industrial bureaucracy— to a future<br>
of postindustrial conviviality— in which the intensity of action would prevail over<br>
production— must begin with a renewal of style in the service institutions— and, first of all,<br>
with a renewal of education. A future which is desirable and feasible depends on our<br>
willingness to invest our technological know-how into the growth of convivial<br>
institutions. In the field of educational research, this amounts to the request for a reversal<br>
of present trends.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 46</p></div><div><p dir="auto">5</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Irrational Consistencies*</p></div><div><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">This chapter was presented originally at a meeting of the American Educational<br>
Research Association, in New York City, February 6, 1971.</li>
</ul></div><div><p dir="auto">I believe that the contemporary crisis of education demands that we review the very idea<br>
of publicly prescribed learning, rather than the methods used in its enforcement. The<br>
dropout rate— especially of junior-high-school students and elementary- school teachers—<br>
points to a grass-roots demand for a completely fresh look. The "classroom practitioner"<br>
who considers himself a liberal teacher is increasingly attacked from all sides. The free-<br>
school movement, confusing discipline with indoctrination, has painted him into the role<br>
of a destructive authoritarian. The educational technologist consistently demonstrates the<br>
teacher's inferiority at measuring and modifying behavior. And the school administration<br>
for which he works forces him to bow to both Summerhill and Skinner, making it<br>
obvious that compulsory learning cannot be a liberal enterprise. No wonder that the<br>
desertion rate of teachers is overtaking that of their students.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">America's commitment to the compulsory education of its young now reveals itself to be<br>
as futile as the pretended American commitment to compulsory democratization of the<br>
Vietnamese. Conventional schools obviously cannot do it. The free-school movement<br>
entices unconventional educators, but ultimately does so in support of the conventional<br>
ideology of schooling. And the promises of educational technologists, that their research<br>
and development— if adequately funded— can offer some kind of final solution to the<br>
resistance of youth to compulsory learning, sound as confident and prove as fatuous as<br>
the analogous promises made by the military technologists.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The criticism directed at the American school system by the behaviorists and that coming<br>
from the new breed of radical educators seem radically opposed. The behaviorists apply<br>
educational research to the "induction of autotelic instruction through individualized<br>
learning packages." Their style clashes with the nondirective cooption of youth into<br>
liberated communes established under the supervision of adults. Yet, in historical<br>
perspective, these two are just contemporary manifestations of the seemingly<br>
contradictory yet really complementary goals of the public school system. From the<br>
beginning of this century, the schools have been protagonists of social control on the one<br>
hand and free cooperation on the other, both placed at the service of the "good society,"<br>
conceived of as a highly organized and smoothly working corporate structure. Under the<br>
impact of intense urbanization, children became a natural resource to be molded by the</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 47</p></div><div><p dir="auto">schools and fed into the industrial machine. Progressive politics and the cult of efficiency<br>
converged in the growth of the U.S. public school.<em> Vocational guidance and the junior<br>
high school were two important results of this kind of thinking. [</em>See Joel Spring,<br>
Education and the Rise of the Corporate State, Cuademo No. 50. Centro Intercultural de<br>
Documentacin, Cuernavaca, Mexico, 1971.]</p></div><div><p dir="auto">It appears, therefore, that the attempt to produce specified behavioral changes which can<br>
be measured and for which the processor can be held accountable is just one side of a<br>
coin, whose other side is the pacification of the new generation within specially<br>
engineered enclaves which will seduce them into the dream world of their elders. These<br>
pacified in society are well described by Dewey, who wants us to "make each one of our<br>
schools an embryonic community life, active with types of occupations that reflect the<br>
life of the larger society, and permeate it with the spirit of art, history and science." In<br>
this historical perspective, it would be a grave mistake to interpret the current three-<br>
cornered controversy between the school establishment, the educational technologists and<br>
the free schools as the prelude to a revolution in education. This controversy reflects<br>
rather a stage of an attempt to escalate an old dream into fact, and to finally make all<br>
valuable learning the result of professional teaching. Most educational alternatives<br>
proposed converge toward goals which are immanent in the production of the cooperative<br>
man whose individual needs are met by means of his specialization in the American<br>
system: They are oriented toward the improvement of what-for lack of a better phrase— I<br>
call the schooled society. Even the seemingly radical critics of the school system are not<br>
willing to abandon the idea that they have an obligation to the young, especially to the<br>
poor, an obligation to process them, whether by love or by fear, into a society which<br>
needs disciplined specialization as much from its producers as from its consumers and<br>
also their full commitment to the ideology which puts economic growth first.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Dissent veils the contradictions inherent in the very idea of school. The established<br>
teachers unions, the technological wizards, and the educational liberation movement<br>
reinforce the commitment of the entire society to the fundamental axioms of a schooled<br>
world, somewhat in the manner in which many peace and protest movements reinforce<br>
the commitments of their members— be they black, female, young, or poor— to seek justice<br>
through the growth of the gross national income.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Some of the tenets which now go unchallenged are easy to list. There is, first, the shared<br>
belief that behavior which has been acquired in the sight of a pedagogue is of special<br>
value to the pupil and of special benefit to society. This is related to the assumption that<br>
social man is bom only in adolescence, and properly born only if he matures in the<br>
school-womb, which some want to gentle by permissiveness, others to stuff with gadgets,<br>
and still others to varnish with a liberal tradition. And there is, finally, a shared view of<br>
youth which is psychologically romantic and politically conservative. According to this<br>
view, changes in society must be brought about by burdening the young with the<br>
responsibility of transforming it-but only after their eventual release from school. It is<br>
easy for a society founded on such tenets to build up a sense of its responsibility for the<br>
education of the new generation, and this inevitably means that some men may set,<br>
specify, and evaluate the personal goals of others. In a "passage from an imaginary</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 48</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Chinese encyclopedia," Jorge Luis Borges tries to evoke the sense of giddiness such an<br>
attempt must produce. He tells us that animals are divided into the following classes: "(a)<br>
those belonging to the emperor, (b) those that are embalmed, (c) those that are<br>
domesticated, (d) the suckling pigs, (e) the sirens, (f) fabulous ones, (g) the roaming<br>
dogs, (h) those included in the present classification, (i) those that drive themselves crazy,<br>
(]) innumerable ones, (k) those painted with a very fine brush of camel hair, (1) et cetera,<br>
(m) those who have just broken the jug, (n) those who resemble flies from afar." Now,<br>
such a taxonomy does not come into being unless somebody feels it can serve his<br>
purpose: in this case, I suppose, that somebody was a tax collector. For him, at least, this<br>
taxonomy of beasts must have made sense, the same way in which the taxonomy of<br>
educational objectives makes sense to scientific authors.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In the peasant, the vision of men with such inscrutable logic, empowered to assess his<br>
cattle, must have induced a chilling sense of impotence. Students, for analogous reasons,<br>
tend to feel paranoiac when they seriously submit to a curriculum. Inevitably they are<br>
even more frightened than my imaginary Chinese peasant, because it is their life goals<br>
rather than their life-stock which is being branded with an inscrutable sign.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">This passage of Borges is fascinating, because it evokes the logic of irrational<br>
consistency which makes Kafka's and Koestler's bureaucracies so sinister yet so evocative<br>
of everyday life. Irrational consistency mesmerizes accomplices who are engaged in<br>
mutually expedient and disciplined exploitation. It is the logic generated by bureaucratic<br>
behavior. And it becomes the logic of a society which demands that the managers of its<br>
educational institutions be held publicly accountable for the behavioral modification they<br>
produce in their clients. Students who can be motivated to value the educational packages<br>
which their teachers obligate them to consume are comparable to Chinese peasants who<br>
can fit their flocks into the tax form provided by Borges.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At some time during the last two generations a commitment to therapy triumphed in<br>
American culture, and teachers came to be regarded as the therapists whose ministrations<br>
all men need, if they wish to enjoy the equality and freedom with which, according to the<br>
Constitution, they are born. Now the teacher-therapists go on to propose lifelong<br>
educational treatment as the next step. The style of this treatment is under discussion:<br>
Should it take the form of continued adult classroom attendance? Electronic ecstasy? Or<br>
periodic sensitivity sessions? All educators are ready to conspire to push out the walls of<br>
the classroom, with the goal of transforming the entire culture into a school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The American controversy over the future of education, behind its rhetoric and noise, is<br>
more conservative than the discourse in other areas of public policy. On foreign affairs, at<br>
least, an organized minority constantly reminds us that the United States must renounce<br>
its role as the world's policeman. Radical economists, and now even their less radical<br>
teachers, question aggregate growth as a desirable goal. There are lobbies for prevention<br>
over cure in medicine and others in favor of fluidity over speed in transportation. Only in<br>
the field of education do the articulate voices demanding a radical deschooling of society<br>
remain so dispersed. There is a lack of cogent argument and of mature leadership aiming<br>
at the disestablishment of any and all institutions which serve the purpose of compulsory</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 49</p></div><div><p dir="auto">learning. For the moment, the radical deschooling of society is still a cause without a<br>
party. This is especially surprising in a time of growing, though chaotic, resistance to all<br>
forms of institutionally planned instruction on the part of those aged twelve to seventeen.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Educational innovators still assume that educational institutions function like funnels for<br>
the programs they package. For my argument it is irrelevant whether these funnels take<br>
the form of a classroom, a TV transmitter, or a "liberated zone." It is equally irrelevant<br>
whether the packages purveyed are rich or poor, hot or cold, hard and measurable (like<br>
Math III), or impossible to assess (like sensitivity). What counts is that education is<br>
assumed to be the result of an institutional process managed by the educator. As long as<br>
the relations continue to be those between a supplier and a consumer, educational<br>
research will remain a circular process. It will amass scientific evidence in support of the<br>
need for more educational packages and for their more deadly accurate delivery to the<br>
individual customer, just as a certain brand of social science can prove the need for the<br>
delivery of more military treatment.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">An educational revolution depends on a twofold inversion: a new orientation for research<br>
and a new understanding of the educational style of an emerging counterculture.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Operational research now seeks to optimize the efficiency of an inherited framework— a<br>
framework which is itself never questioned. This framework has the syntactic structure of<br>
a funnel for teaching packages. The syntactic alternative to it is an educational network or<br>
web for the autonomous assembly of resources under the personal control of each learner.<br>
This alternative structure of an educational institution now lies within the conceptual<br>
blind spot of our operational research. If research were to focus on it, this would<br>
constitute a true scientific revolution.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The blind spot of educational research reflects the cultural bias of a society in which<br>
technological growth has been confused with technocratic control. For the technocrat the<br>
value of an environment increases as more contacts between each man and his milieu can<br>
be programmed. In this world the choices which are manageable for the observer or<br>
planner converge with the choices possible for the observed so-called beneficiary.<br>
Freedom is reduced to a selection among packaged commodities.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The emerging counterculture reaffirms the values of semantic content above the<br>
efficiency of increased and more rigid syntax. It values the wealth of connotation above<br>
the power of syntax to produce wealth. It values the unpredictable outcome of self-chosen<br>
personal encounter above the certified quality of professional instruction. This<br>
reorientation toward personal surprise rather than institutionally engineered values will be<br>
disruptive of the established order until we dissociate the increasing availability of<br>
technological tools which facilitate encounter from the increasing control of the<br>
technocrat of what happens when people meet.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Our present educational institutions are at the service of the teacher's goals. The relational<br>
structures we need are those which will enable each man to define himself by learning<br>
and by contributing to the learning of others.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 50</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page #51</p></div><div><p dir="auto">6</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Learning Webs</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In a previous chapter I discussed what is becoming a common complaint about schools,<br>
one that is reflected, for example, in the recent report of the Carnegie Commission: In<br>
school registered students submit to certified teachers in order to obtain certificates of<br>
their own; both are frustrated and both blame insufficient resources— money, time, or<br>
buildings— for their mutual frustration.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Such criticism leads many people to ask whether it is possible to conceive of a different<br>
style of learning. The same people, paradoxically, when pressed to specify how they<br>
acquired what they know and value, will readily admit that they learned it more often<br>
outside than inside school. Their knowledge of facts, their understanding of life and work<br>
came to them from friendship or love, while viewing TV, or while reading, from<br>
examples of peers or the challenge of a street encounter. Or they may have learned what<br>
they know through the apprenticeship ritual for admission to a street gang or the initiation<br>
to a hospital, newspaper city room, plumber's shop, or insurance office. The alternative to<br>
dependence on schools is not the use of public resources for some new device which<br>
"makes" people learn; rather it is the creation of a new style of educational relationship<br>
between man and his environment. To foster this style, attitudes toward growing up, the<br>
tools available for learning, and the quality and structure of daily life will have to change<br>
concurrently.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Attitudes are already changing. The proud dependence on school is gone. Consumer<br>
resistance increases in the knowledge industry. Many teachers and pupils, taxpayers and<br>
employers, economists and policemen would prefer not to depend any longer on schools.<br>
What prevents their frustration from shaping new institutions is a lack not only of<br>
imagination but frequently also of appropriate language and of enlightened self-interest.<br>
They cannot visualize either a deschooled society or educational institutions in a society<br>
which has disestablished school.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In this chapter I intend to show that the inverse of school is possible: that we can depend<br>
on self-motivated learning instead of employing teachers to bribe or compel the student<br>
to find the time and the will to learn; that we can provide the learner with new links to the<br>
world instead of continuing to funnel all educational programs through the teacher. I shall<br>
discuss some of the general characteristics which distinguish schooling from learning and<br>
outline four major categories of educational institutions which should appeal not only to<br>
many individuals but also to many existing interest groups.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 52</p></div><div><p dir="auto">An Objection: Who Can Be Served by Bridges to Nowhere?</p></div><div><p dir="auto">We are used to considering schools as a variable, dependent on the political and<br>
economic structure. If we can change the style of political leadership, or promote the<br>
interests of one class or another, or switch from private to public ownership of the means<br>
of production, we assume the school system will change as well. The educational<br>
institutions I will propose, however, are meant to serve a society which does not now<br>
exist, although the current frustration with schools is itself potentially a major force to set<br>
in motion change toward new social arrangements. An obvious objection has been raised<br>
to this approach: Why channel energy to build bridges to nowhere, instead of marshaling<br>
it first to change not the schools but the political and economic system?</p></div><div><p dir="auto">This objection, however, underestimates the fundamental political and economic nature<br>
of the school system itself, as well as the political potential inherent in any effective<br>
challenge to it. In a basic sense, schools have ceased to be dependent on the ideology<br>
professed by any government or market organization. Other basic institutions might differ<br>
from one country to another: family, party, church, or press. But everywhere the school<br>
system has the same structure, and everywhere its hidden curriculum has the same effect.<br>
Invariably, it shapes the consumer who values institutional commodities above the<br>
nonprofessional ministration of a neighbor.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Everywhere the hidden curriculum of schooling initiates the citizen to the myth that<br>
bureaucracies guided by scientific knowledge are efficient and benevolent. Everywhere<br>
this same curriculum instills in the pupil the myth that increased production will""<br>
provide a better life. And everywhere it develops the habit of self-defeating consumption<br>
of services and alienating production, the tolerance for institutional dependence, and the<br>
recognition of institutional rankings. The hidden curriculum of school does all this in<br>
spite of contrary efforts undertaken by teachers and no matter what ideology prevails.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In other words, schools are fundamentally alike in all countries, be they fascist,<br>
democratic or socialist, big or small, rich or poor. This identity of the school system<br>
forces us to recognize the profound world-wide identity of myth, mode of production,<br>
and method of social control, despite the great variety of mythologies in which the myth<br>
finds expression.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In view of this identity, it is illusory to claim that schools are, in any profound sense,<br>
dependent variables. This means that to hope for fundamental change in the school<br>
system as an effect of conventionally conceived social or economic change is also an<br>
illusion. Moreover, this illusion grants the school— the reproductive organ of a consumer<br>
society-almost unquestioned immunity.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">It is at this point that the example of China becomes important. For three millennia,</p></div><div><p dir="auto">China protected higher learning through a total divorce between the process of learning<br>
and the privilege conferred by mandarin examinations. To become a world power and a</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 53</p></div><div><p dir="auto">modern nation-state, China had to adopt the international style of schooling. Only<br>
hindsight will allow us to discover if the Great Cultural Revolution will turn out to have<br>
been the first successful attempt at deschooling the institutions of society.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Even the piecemeal creation of new educational agencies which were the inverse of<br>
school would be an attack on the most sensitive link of a pervasive phenomenon, which is<br>
organized by the state in all countries. A political program which does not explicitly<br>
recognize the need for deschooling is not revolutionary; it is demagoguery calling for<br>
more of the same. Any major political program of the seventies should be evaluated by<br>
this measure: How clearly does it state the need for deschooling— and how clearly does it<br>
provide guidelines for the educational quality of the society for which it aims?</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The struggle against domination by the world market and big-power politics might be<br>
beyond some poor communities or countries, but this weakness is an added reason for<br>
emphasizing the importance of liberating each society through a reversal of its<br>
educational structure, a change which is not beyond any society's means.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">General Characteristics of New Formal Educational Institutions</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all who want to<br>
learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want<br>
to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally,<br>
furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their<br>
challenge known. Such a system would require the application of constitutional<br>
guarantees to education. Learners should not be forced to submit to an obligatory<br>
curriculum, or to discrimination based on whether they possess a certificate or a diploma.<br>
Nor should the public be forced to support, through a regressive taxation, a huge<br>
professional apparatus of educators and buildings which in fact restricts the public's<br>
chances for learning to the services the profession is willing to put on the market. It<br>
should use modern technology to make free speech, free assembly, and a free press truly<br>
universal and, therefore, fully educational.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Schools are designed on the assumption that there is a secret to everything in life; that the<br>
quality of life depends on knowing that secret; that secrets can be known only in orderly<br>
successions; and that only teachers can properly reveal these secrets. An individual with a<br>
schooled mind conceives of the world as a pyramid of classified packages accessible only<br>
to those who carry the proper tags. New educational institutions would break apart this<br>
pyramid. Their purpose must be to facilitate access for the learner: to allow him to look<br>
into the windows of the control room or the parliament, if he cannot get in by the door.<br>
Moreover, such new institutions should be channels to which the learner would have<br>
access without credentials or pedigree-public spaces in which peers and elders outside<br>
his immediate horizon would become available.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I believe that no more than four— possibly even three— distinct "channels" or learning<br>
exchanges could contain all the resources needed for real learning. The child grows up in<br>
a world of things, surrounded by people who serve as models for skills and values. He</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 54</p></div><div><p dir="auto">finds peers who challenge him to argue, to compete, to cooperate, and to understand; and<br>
if the child is lucky, he is exposed to confrontation or criticism by an experienced elder<br>
who really cares. Things, models, peers, and elders are four resources each of which<br>
requires a different type of arrangement to ensure that everybody has ample access to it.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I will use the words "opportunity web" for "network" to designate specific ways to<br>
provide access to each of four sets of resources. "Network" is often used, unfortunately,<br>
to designate the channels reserved to material selected by others for indoctrination,<br>
instruction, and entertainment. But it can also be used for the telephone or the postal<br>
service, which are primarily accessible to individuals who want to send messages to one<br>
another. I wish we had another word to designate such reticular structures for mutual<br>
access, a word less evocative of entrapment, less degraded by current usage and more<br>
suggestive of the fact that any such arrangement includes legal, organizational, and<br>
technical aspects. Not having found such a term, I will try to redeem the one which is<br>
available, using it as a synonym of "educational web."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">What are needed are new networks, readily available to the public and designed to spread<br>
equal opportunity for learning and teaching.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To give an example: The same level of technology is used in TV and in tape recorders.<br>
All Latin- American countries now have introduced TV: in Bolivia the government has<br>
financed a TV station, which was built six years ago, and there are no more than seven<br>
thousand TV sets for four million citizens. The money now tied up in TV installations<br>
throughout Latin America could have provided every fifth adult with a tape recorder. In<br>
addition, the money would have sufficed to provide an almost unlimited library of<br>
prerecorded tapes, with outlets even in remote villages, as well as an ample supply of<br>
empty tapes.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">This network of tape recorders, of course, would be radically different from the present<br>
network of TV. It would provide opportunity for free expression: literate and illiterate<br>
alike could record, preserve, disseminate, and repeat their opinions. The present<br>
investment in TV, instead, provides bureaucrats, whether politicians or educators, with<br>
the power to sprinkle the continent with institutionally produced programs which they-or<br>
their sponsors— decide are good for or in demand by the people.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Technology is available to develop either independence and learning or bureaucracy and<br>
teaching.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Four Networks</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The planning of new educational institutions ought not to begin with the administrative<br>
goals of a principal or president, or with the teaching goals of a professional educator, or<br>
with the learning goals of any hypothetical class of people. It must not start with the<br>
question, "What should someone learn?" but with the question, "What kinds of things and<br>
people might learners want to be in contact with in order to learn?"</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 55</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Someone who wants to learn knows that he needs both information and critical response<br>
to its use from somebody else. Information can be stored in things and in persons. In a<br>
good educational system access to things ought to be available at the sole bidding of the<br>
learner, while access to informants requires, in addition, others' consent. Criticism can<br>
also come from two directions: from peers or from elders, that is, from fellow learners<br>
whose immediate interests match mine, or from those who will grant me a share in their<br>
superior experience. Peers can be colleagues with whom to raise a question, companions<br>
for playful and enjoyable (or arduous) reading or walking, challengers at any type of<br>
game. Elders can be consultants on which skill to learn, which method to use, what<br>
company to seek at a given moment. They can be guides to the right questions to be<br>
raised among peers and to the deficiency of the answers they arrive at. Most of these<br>
resources are plentiful. But they are neither conventionally perceived as educational<br>
resources, nor is access to them for learning purposes easy, especially for the poor. We<br>
must conceive of new relational structures which are deliberately set up to facilitate<br>
access to these resources for the use of anybody who is motivated to seek them for his<br>
education. Administrative, technological, and especially legal arrangements are required<br>
to set up such web-like structures.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Educational resources are usually labeled according to educators' curricular goals. I<br>
propose to do the contrary, to label four different approaches which enable the student to<br>
gain access to any educational resource which may help him to define and achieve his<br>
own goals:</p></div><div><ol>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">
<p>Reference Services to Educational Objects-which facilitate access to things or<br>
processes used for formal learning. Some of these things can be reserved for this purpose,<br>
stored in libraries, rental agencies, laboratories, and showrooms like museums and<br>
theaters; others can be in daily use in factories, airports, or on farms, but made available<br>
to students as apprentices or on off hours.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="6" dir="auto">
<p>Skill Exchanges— which permit persons to list their skills, the conditions under which<br>
they are willing to serve as models for others who want to learn these skills, and the<br>
addresses at which they can be reached.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="10" dir="auto">
<p>Peer-Matching— a communications network which permits persons to describe the<br>
learning activity in which they wish to engage, in the hope of finding a partner for the<br>
inquiry.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="14" dir="auto">
<p>Reference Services to Educators-at-Large— who can be listed in a directory giving the<br>
addresses and self-descriptions of professionals, paraprofessionals, and free-lancers,<br>
along with conditions of access to their services. Such educators, as we will see, could be<br>
chosen by polling or consulting their former clients.</p>
</li>
</ol></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 56</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Reference Services to Educational Objects</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Things are basic resources for learning. The quality of the environment and the<br>
relationship of a person to it will determine how much he learns incidentally. Formal<br>
learning requires special access to ordinary things, on the one hand, or, on the other, easy<br>
and dependable access to special things made for educational purposes. An example of<br>
the former is the special right to operate or dismantle a machine in a garage. An example<br>
of the latter is the general right to use an abacus, a computer, a book, a botanical garden,<br>
or a machine withdrawn from production and placed at the full disposal of students.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At present, attention is focused on the disparity between rich and poor children in their<br>
access to things and in the manner in which they can learn from them. OEO and other<br>
agencies, following this approach, concentrate on equalizing chances, by trying to<br>
provide more educational equipment for the poor. A more radical point of departure<br>
would be to recognize that in the city rich and poor alike are artificially kept away from<br>
most of the things that surround them. Children bom into the age of plastics and<br>
efficiency experts must penetrate two barriers which obstruct their understanding: one<br>
built into things and the other around institutions. Industrial design creates a world of<br>
things that resist insight into their nature, and schools shut the learner out of the world of<br>
things in their meaningful setting.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">After a short visit to New York, a woman from a Mexican village told me she was<br>
impressed by the fact that stores sold only wares heavily made up with cosmetics." I<br>
understood her to mean that industrial products "speak" to their customers about their<br>
allurements and not about their nature. Industry has surrounded people with artifacts<br>
whose inner workings only specialists are allowed to understand. The nonspecialist is<br>
discouraged from figuring out what makes a watch tick, or a tele-phone ring, or an<br>
electric typewriter work, by being warned that it will break if he tries. He can be told<br>
what makes a transistor radio work, but he cannot find out for himself. This type of<br>
design tends to reinforce a noninventive society in which the experts find it progressively<br>
easier to hide behind their expertise and beyond evaluation.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The man-made environment has become as inscrutable as nature is for the primitive. At<br>
the same time, educational materials have been monopolized by school. Simple<br>
educational objects have been expensively packaged by the knowledge industry. They<br>
have become specialized tools for professional educators, and their cost has been inflated<br>
by forcing them to stimulate either environments or teachers.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The teacher is jealous of the textbook he defines as his professional implement. The<br>
student may come to hate the lab because he associates it with schoolwork. The<br>
administrator rationalizes his protective attitude toward the library as a defense of costly<br>
public equipment against those who would play with it rather than learn. In this<br>
atmosphere the student too often uses the map, the lab, the encyclopedia, or the<br>
microscope only at the rare moments when the curriculum tells him to do so. Even the<br>
great classics become part of "sophomore year" instead of marking a new turn in a</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 57</p></div><div><p dir="auto">person's life. School removes things from everyday use by labeling them educational<br>
tools.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">If we are to deschool, both tendencies must be reversed. The general physical<br>
environment must be made accessible, and those physical learning resources which have<br>
been reduced to teaching instruments must become generally available for self-directed<br>
learning. Using things only as part of a curriculum can have an even worse effect than<br>
just removing them from the general environment. It can corrupt the attitudes of pupils.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Games are a case in point. I do not mean the "games" of the physical education<br>
department (such as football and basketball), which the schools use to raise income and<br>
prestige and in which they have made a substantial capital investment. As the athletes<br>
themselves are well aware, these enterprises, which take the form of warlike tournaments,<br>
have undermined the playfulness of sports and are used to reinforce the competitive<br>
nature of schools. Rather I have in mind the educational games which can provide a<br>
unique way to penetrate formal systems. Set theory, linguistics, propositional logic,<br>
geometry, physics, and even chemistry reveal themselves with little effort to certain<br>
persons who play these games. A friend of mine went to a Mexican market with a game<br>
called '"Wff 'n Proof," which consists of some dice on which twelve logical symbols are<br>
imprinted. He showed children which two or three combinations constituted a well-<br>
formed sentence, and inductively within the first hour some onlookers also grasped the<br>
principle. Within a few hours of playfully conducting formal logical proofs, some<br>
children are capable of introducing others to the fundamental proofs of propositional<br>
logic. The others just walk away.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In fact, for some children such games are a special form of liberating education, since<br>
they heighten their awareness of the fact that formal systems are built on changeable<br>
axioms and that conceptual operations have a gamelike nature. They are also simple,<br>
cheap, and-to a large extent-can be organized by the players themselves. Used outside<br>
the curriculum such games provide an opportunity for identifying and developing unusual<br>
talent, while the school psychologist will often identify those who have such talent as in<br>
danger of becoming antisocial, sick, or unbalanced. Within school, when used in the form<br>
of tournaments, games are not only removed from the sphere of leisure; they often<br>
become tools used to translate playfulness into competition, a lack of abstract reasoning<br>
into a sign of inferiority. An exercise which is liberating for some character types<br>
becomes a straitjacket for others.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The control of school over educational equipment has still another effect. It increases<br>
enormously the cost of such cheap materials. Once their use is restricted to scheduled<br>
hours, professionals are paid to supervise their acquisition, storage, and use. Then<br>
students vent their anger against the school on the equipment, which must be purchased<br>
once again.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Paralleling the untouchability of teaching tools is the impenetrability of modern junk. In<br>
the thirties any self-respecting boy knew how to repair an automobile, but now car<br>
makers multiply wires and withhold manuals from everyone except specialized</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 58</p></div><div><p dir="auto">mechanics. In a former era an old radio contained enough coils and condensers to build a<br>
transmitter that would make all the neighborhood radios scream in feedback. Transistor<br>
radios are more portable, but nobody dares to take them apart. To change this in the<br>
highly industrialized countries will be immensely difficult; but at least in the Third World<br>
we must insist on built-in educational qualities.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To illustrate my point, let me present a model: By spending ten million dollars it would<br>
be possible to connect forty thousand hamlets in a country like Peru with a spiderweb of<br>
six-foot-wide trails and maintain these, and, in addition, provide the country with 200,000<br>
three-wheeled mechanical donkeys— five on the average for each hamlet. Few poor<br>
countries of this size spend less than this yearly on cars and roads, both of which are now<br>
restricted mainly to the rich and their employees, while poor people remain trapped in<br>
their villages. Each of these simple but durable little vehicles would cost $125— half of<br>
which would pay for transmission and a six-horsepower motor. A "donkey" could make<br>
15 mph, and it can carry loads of 850 pounds (that is, most things besides tree trunks and<br>
steel beams which are ordinarily moved).</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The political appeal of such a transportation system to a peasantry is obvious. Equally<br>
obvious is the reason why those who hold power— and thereby automatically have a car-<br>
are not interested in spending money on trails and in clogging roads with engine-driven<br>
donkeys. The universal donkey could work only if a country's leaders were willing to<br>
impose a national speed limit of, say, twenty-five miles an hour and adapt its public<br>
institutions to this. The model could not work if conceived only as a stopgap.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">This is not the place to elaborate on the political, social, economic, financial, and<br>
technical feasibility of this model. I wish only to indicate that educational considerations<br>
may be of prime importance when choosing such an alternative to capital, intensive<br>
transport. By raising the unit cost per donkey by some 20 percent it would become<br>
possible to plan the production of all its parts in such a manner that, as far as possible,<br>
each future owner would spend a month or two making and understanding his machine<br>
and would be able to repair it. With this additional cost it would also be possible to<br>
decentralize production into dispersed plants. The added benefits would result not only<br>
from including educational costs in the construction process. Even more significantly, a<br>
durable motor which practically anyone could leam to repair and which could be used as<br>
a plow and pump by somebody who understood it would provide much higher<br>
educational benefits than the inscrutable engines of the advanced countries.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Not only the junk but also the supposedly public places of the modern city have become<br>
impenetrable. In American society, children are excluded from most things and places on<br>
the grounds that they are private. But even in societies which have declared an end to<br>
private property children are kept away from the same places and things because they are<br>
considered the special domain of professionals and dangerous to the uninitiated. Since the<br>
last generation the railroad yard has become as inaccessible as the fire station. Yet with a<br>
little ingenuity it should not be difficult to provide for safety in such places. To deschool<br>
the artifacts of education will require making the artifacts and processes available— and<br>
recognizing their educational value. Certainly, some workers would find it inconvenient</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 59</p></div><div><p dir="auto">to be accessible to learners; but this inconvenience must be balanced against the<br>
educational gains.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Private cars could be banned from Manhattan. Five years ago it was unthinkable. Now<br>
certain New York streets are closed off at odd hours, and this trend will probably<br>
continue. Indeed, most cross-streets should be closed to automotive traffic and parking<br>
should be forbidden everywhere. In a city opened up to people, teaching materials which<br>
are now locked up in store-rooms and laboratories could be dispersed into independently<br>
operated storefront depots which children and adults could visit without the danger of<br>
being run over.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">If the goals of learning were no longer dominated by schools and schoolteachers, the<br>
market for learners would be much more various and the definition of "educational<br>
artifacts" would be less restrictive. There could be tool shops, libraries, laboratories, and<br>
gaming rooms. Photo labs and offset presses would allow neighborhood newspapers to<br>
flourish. Some storefront learning centers could contain viewing booths for closed-circuit<br>
television, others could feature office equipment for use and for repair. The jukebox or<br>
the record player would be commonplace, with some specializing in classical music,<br>
others in international folk tunes, others in jazz. Film clubs would compete with each<br>
other and with commercial television. Museum outlets could be networks for circulating<br>
exhibits of works of art, both old and new, originals and reproductions, perhaps<br>
administered by the various metropolitan museums.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The professional personnel needed for this network would be much more like custodians,<br>
museum guides, or reference librarians than like teachers. From the comer biology store,<br>
they could refer their clients to the shell collection in the museum or indicate the next<br>
showing of biology videotapes in a certain viewing booth. They could furnish guides for<br>
pest control, diet, and other kinds of preventive medicine. They could refer those who<br>
needed advice to "elders" who could provide it.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Two distinct approaches can be taken to financing a network of "learning objects." A<br>
community could determine a maximum budget for this purpose and arrange for all parts<br>
of the network to be open to all visitors at reasonable hours. Or the community could<br>
decide to provide citizens with limited entitlements, according to their age group, which<br>
would give them special access to certain materials which are both costly and scarce,<br>
while leaving other, simpler materials available to everyone.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Finding resources for materials made specifically for education is only one— and perhaps<br>
the least costly— aspect of building an educational world. The money now spent on the<br>
sacred paraphernalia of the school ritual could be freed to provide all citizens with greater<br>
access to the real life of the city. Special tax incentives could be granted to those who<br>
employed children between the ages of eight and fourteen for a couple of hours each day<br>
if the conditions of employment were humane ones. We should return to the tradition of<br>
the bar mitzvah or confirmation. By this I mean we should first restrict, and later<br>
eliminate, the disenfranchisement of the young and permit a boy of twelve to become a<br>
man fully responsible for his participation in the life of the community. Many "school-</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 60</p></div><div><p dir="auto">age" people know more about their neighborhood than social workers or councilmen. Of<br>
course, they also ask more embarrassing questions and propose solutions which threaten<br>
the bureaucracy. They should be allowed to come of age so that they could put their<br>
knowledge and fact-finding ability to work in the service of a popular government.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Until recently the dangers of school were easily underestimated in comparison with the<br>
dangers of an apprenticeship in the police force, the fire department, or the entertainment<br>
industry. It was easy to justify schools at least as a means to protect youth. Often this<br>
argument no longer holds. I recently visited a Methodist church in Harlem occupied by a<br>
group of armed Young Lords in protest against the death of Julio Rodan, a Puerto Rican<br>
youth found hanged in his prison cell. I knew the leaders of the group, who had spent a<br>
semester in Cuernavaca. When I wondered why one of them, Juan, was not among them,</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I was told that he had "gone back on heroin and to the State University."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Planning, incentives, and legislation can be used to unlock the educational potential<br>
within our society's huge investment in plants and equipment. Full access to educational<br>
objects will not exist so long as business firms are allowed to combine the legal<br>
protections which the Bill of Rights reserves to the privacy of individuals with the<br>
economic power conferred upon them by their millions of customers and thousands of<br>
employees, stockholders, and suppliers. Much of the world's know-how and most of its<br>
productive processes and equipment are locked within the walls of business firms, away<br>
from their customers, employees, and stockholders, as well as from the general public,<br>
whose laws and facilities allow them to function. Money now spent on advertising in<br>
capitalist countries could be redirected toward education in and by General Electric,<br>
NBC-TV, or Budweiser beer. That is, the plants and offices should be reorganized so that<br>
their daily operations could be more accessible to the public in ways that would make<br>
learning possible; and, indeed, ways might be found to pay the companies for the learning<br>
people acquired from them.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">An even more valuable body of scientific objects and data may be withheld from general<br>
access— and even from qualified scientists— under the guise of national security. Until<br>
recently science was the one forum which functioned like an anarchist's dream. Each man<br>
capable of doing research had more or less the same opportunity of access to its tools and<br>
to a hearing by the community of peers. Now bureaucratization and organization have<br>
placed much of science beyond public reach. Indeed, what used to be an international<br>
network of scientific information has been splintered into an arena of competing teams.<br>
The members as well as the artifacts of the scientific community have been locked into<br>
national and corporate programs oriented toward practical achievement, to the radical<br>
impoverishment of the men who support these nations and corporations.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In a world which is controlled and owned by nations and corporations, only limited<br>
access to educational objects will ever be possible. But increased access to those objects<br>
which can be shared for educational purposes may enlighten us enough to help us to<br>
break through these ultimate political barriers. Public schools transfer control over the<br>
educational uses of objects from private to professional hands. The institutional inversion<br>
of schools could empower the individual to reclaim the right to use them for education. A</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 61</p></div><div><p dir="auto">truly public kind of ownership might begin to emerge if private or corporate control over<br>
the educational aspect of "things" were brought to the vanishing point.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Skill Exchanges</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A guitar teacher, unlike a guitar, can be neither classified in a museum nor owned by the<br>
public nor rented from an educational warehouse. Teachers of skills belong to a different<br>
class of resources from objects needed to learn a skill. This is not to say that they are<br>
indispensable in every case. I can rent not only a guitar but also taped guitar lessons and<br>
illustrated chord charts, and with these things I can teach myself to play the guitar.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Indeed, this arrangement may have advantages-if the available tapes are better than the<br>
available teachers, or if the only time I have for learning the guitar is late at night, or if<br>
the tunes I wish to play are unknown in my country, or if I am shy and prefer to fumble<br>
along in privacy.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Skill teachers must be listed and contacted through a different kind of channel from that<br>
of things. A thing is available at the bidding of the user— or could be— whereas a person<br>
formally becomes a skill resource only when he consents to do so, and he can also restrict<br>
time, place, and method as he chooses.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Skill teachers must be also distinguished from peers from whom one would learn. Peers<br>
who wish to pursue a common inquiry must start from common interests and abilities;<br>
they get together to exercise or improve a skill they share: basketball, dancing,<br>
constructing a camp site, or discussing the next election. The first transmission of a skill,<br>
on the other hand, involves bringing together someone who has the skill and someone<br>
who does not have it and wants to acquire it.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A "skill model" is a person who possesses a skill and is willing to demonstrate its<br>
practice. A demonstration of this kind is frequently a necessary resource for a potential<br>
learner. Modern inventions permit us to incorporate demonstration into tape, film, or<br>
chart; yet one would hope personal demonstration will remain in wide demand, especially<br>
in communication skills. Some ten thousand adults have learned Spanish at our Center at<br>
Cuernavaca— mostly highly motivated persons who wanted to acquire near-native fluency<br>
in a second language. When they are faced with a choice between carefully programmed<br>
instruction in a lab or drill sessions with two other students and a native speaker<br>
following a rigid routine, most choose the second.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">For most widely shared skills, a person who demonstrates the skill is the only human<br>
resource we ever need or get. Whether in speaking or driving, in cooking or in the use of<br>
communication equipment, we are often barely conscious of formal instruction and<br>
learning, especially after our first experience of the materials in question. I see no reason<br>
why other complex skills, such as the mechanical aspects of surgery and playing the<br>
fiddle, of reading or the use of directories and catalogues, could not be learned in the<br>
same way.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 62</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A well-motivated student who does not labor under a specific handicap often needs no<br>
further human assistance than can be provided by someone who can demonstrate on<br>
demand how to do what the learner wants to learn to do. The demand made of skilled<br>
people that before demonstrating their skill they be certified as pedagogues is a result of<br>
the insistence either that people learn what they do not want to know or that all people-<br>
even those with a special handicap— learn certain things, at a given moment in their lives,<br>
and preferably under specified circumstances.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">What makes skills scarce on the present educational market is the institutional<br>
requirement that those who can demonstrate them may not do so unless they are given<br>
public trust, through a certificate. We insist that those who help others acquire a skill<br>
should also know how to diagnose learning difficulties and be able to motivate people to<br>
aspire to learn skills. In short, we demand that they be pedagogues. People who can<br>
demonstrate skills will be plentiful as soon as we learn to recognize them outside the<br>
teaching profession.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Where princelings are being taught, the parents' insistence that the teacher and the person<br>
with skills be combined in one person is understandable, if no longer defensible. But for<br>
all parents to aspire to have Aristotle for their Alexander is obviously self-defeating. The<br>
person who can both inspire students and demonstrate a technique is so rare, and so hard<br>
to recognize, that even princelings more often get a sophist than a true philosopher.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A demand for scarce skills can be quickly filled even if there are only small numbers of<br>
people to demonstrate them; but such people must be easily available. During the forties<br>
radio repairmen, most of them with no schooling in their work, were no more than two<br>
years behind radios in penetrating the interior of Latin America. There they stayed until<br>
transistor radios, which are cheap to purchase and impossible to repair, put them out of<br>
business. Technical schools now fail to accomplish what repair, men of equally useful,<br>
more durable radios could do as a matter of course.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Converging self-interests now conspire to stop a man from sharing his skill. The man<br>
who has the skill profits from its scarcity and not from its reproduction. The teacher who<br>
special, izes in transmitting the skill profits from the artisan's unwillingness to launch his<br>
own apprentice into the field. The public is indoctrinated to believe that skills are<br>
valuable and reliable only if they are the result of formal schooling. The job market<br>
depends on making skills scarce and on keeping them scarce, either by proscribing their<br>
unauthorized use and transmission or by making things which can be operated and<br>
repaired only by those who have access to tools or information which are kept scarce.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Schools thus produce shortages of skilled persons. A good example is the diminishing<br>
number of nurses in the United States, owing to the rapid increase of four-year B.S.<br>
programs in nursing. Women from poorer families, who would formerly have enrolled in<br>
a two- or three-year program, now stay out of the nursing profession altogether.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Insisting on the certification of teachers is another way of keeping skills scarce. If nurses<br>
were encouraged to train nurses, and if nurses were employed on the basis of their proven</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 63</p></div><div><p dir="auto">skill at giving injections, filling out charts, and giving medicine, there would soon be no<br>
lack of trained nurses. Certification now tends to abridge the freedom of education by<br>
converting the civil right to share one's knowledge into the privilege of academic<br>
freedom, now conferred only on the employees of a school. To guarantee access to an<br>
effective exchange of skills, we need legislation which generalizes academic freedom.<br>
The right to teach any skill should come under the protection of freedom of speech. Once<br>
restrictions on teaching are removed, they will quickly be removed from learning as well.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The teacher of skills needs some inducement to grant his services to a pupil. There are at<br>
least two simple ways to begin to channel public funds to noncertified teachers. One way<br>
would be to institutionalize the skill exchange by creating free skill centers open to the<br>
public. Such centers could and should be established in industrialized areas, at least for<br>
those skills which are fundamental prerequisites for entering certain apprenticeships—<br>
such skills as reading, typing, keeping accounts, foreign languages, computer<br>
programming and number manipulation, reading special languages such as that of<br>
electrical circuits, manipulation of certain machinery, etc. Another approach would be to<br>
give certain groups within the population educational currency good for attendance at<br>
skill centers where other clients would have to pay commercial rates.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A much more radical approach would be to create a "bank" for skill exchange. Each<br>
citizen would be given a basic credit with which to acquire fundamental skills. Beyond<br>
that minimum, further credits would go to those who earned them by teaching, whether<br>
they served as models in organized skill centers or did so privately at home or on the<br>
playground. Only those who had taught others for an equivalent amount of time would<br>
have a claim on the time of more advanced teachers. An entirely new elite would be<br>
promoted, an elite of those who earned their education by sharing it.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Should parents have the right to earn skill credit for their children? Since such an<br>
arrangement would give further advantage to the privileged classes, it might be offset by<br>
granting a larger credit to the underprivileged. The operation of a skill exchange would<br>
depend on the existence of agencies which would facilitate the development of directory<br>
information and assure its free and inexpensive use. Such an agency might also provide<br>
supplementary services of testing and certification and might help to enforce the<br>
legislation required to break up and prevent monopolistic practices.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Fundamentally, the freedom of a universal skill exchange must be guaranteed by laws<br>
which permit discrimination only on the basis of tested skills and not on the basis of<br>
educational pedigree. Such a guarantee inevitably requires public control over tests which<br>
may be used to qualify persons for the job market. Otherwise, it would be possible to<br>
surreptitiously reintroduce complex batteries of tests at the work place itself which would<br>
serve for social selection. Much could be done to make skill-testing objective, e.g.,<br>
allowing only the operation of specific machines or systems to be tested. Tests of typing<br>
(measured according to speed, number of errors, and whether or not the typist can work<br>
from dictation), operation of an accounting system or of a hydraulic crane, driving,<br>
coding into COBOL, etc., can easily be made objective.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 64</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In fact, many of the true skills which are of practical importance can be so tested. And for<br>
the purposes of manpower management a test of a current skill level is much more useful<br>
than the information that twenty years ago a person satisfied his teacher in a curriculum<br>
in which typing, stenography, and accounting were taught. The very need for official<br>
skill-testing can, of course, be questioned: I personally believe that freedom from undue<br>
hurt to a man's reputation through labeling is better guaranteed by restricting than by<br>
forbidding tests of competence.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Peer-Matching</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At their worst, schools gather classmates into the same room and subject them to the<br>
same sequence of treatment in math, citizenship, and spelling. At their best, they permit<br>
each student to choose one of a limited number of courses. In any case, groups of peers<br>
form around the goals of teachers. A desirable educational system would let each person<br>
specify the activity for which he sought a peer.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">School does offer children an opportunity to escape their homes and meet new friends.<br>
But, at the same time, this process indoctrinates children with the idea that they should<br>
select their friends from among those with whom they are put together. Providing the<br>
young from their earliest age with invitations to meet, evaluate, and seek out others<br>
would prepare them for a lifelong interest in seeking new partners for new endeavors.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A good chess player is always glad to find a close match, and one novice to find another.<br>
Clubs serve their purpose. People who want to discuss specific books or articles would<br>
probably pay to find discussion partners. People who want to play games, go on<br>
excursions, build fish tanks, or motorize bicycles will go to considerable lengths to find<br>
peers. The reward for their efforts is finding those peers. Good schools try to bring out<br>
the common interests of their students registered in the same program. The inverse of<br>
school would be an institution which increased the chances that persons who at a given<br>
moment shared the same specific interest could meet— no matter what else they had in<br>
common.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Skill-teaching does not provide equal benefits for both parties, as does the matching of<br>
peers. The teacher of skills, as I have pointed out, must usually be offered some incentive<br>
beyond the rewards of teaching. Skill-teaching is a matter of repeating drills over and<br>
over and is, in fact, all the more dreary for those pupils who need it most. A skill<br>
exchange needs currency or credits or other tangible incentives in order to operate, even<br>
if the exchange itself were to generate a currency of its own. A peer-match, ing system<br>
requires no such incentives, but only a communications network.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Tapes, retrieval systems, programmed instruction, and reproduction of shapes and sounds<br>
tend to reduce the need for recourse to human teachers of many skills; they increase the<br>
efficiency of teachers and the number of skills one can pick up in a lifetime. Parallel to<br>
this runs an increased need to meet people interested in enjoying the newly acquired skill.<br>
A student who has picked up Greek before her vacation would like to discuss in Greek<br>
Cretan politics when she returns. A Mexican in New York wants to find other readers of</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 65</p></div><div><p dir="auto">the paper Siempre — or of "Los Agachaclos, ” the most popular comic book. Somebody<br>
else wants to meet peers who, like himself, would like to increase their interest in the<br>
work of James Baldwin or of Bolivar.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify<br>
himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A<br>
computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the<br>
same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad<br>
scale for publicly valued activity.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In its most rudimentary form, communication between client and computer could be<br>
established by return mail. In big cities typewriter terminals could provide instantaneous<br>
responses. The only way to retrieve a name and address from the computer would be to<br>
list an activity for which a peer was sought. People using the system would become<br>
known only to their potential peers.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A complement to the computer could be a network of bulletin boards and classified<br>
newspaper ads, listing the activities for which the computer could not produce a match.<br>
No names would have to be given. Interested readers would then introduce their names<br>
into the system. A publicly supported peer-match network might be the only way to<br>
guarantee the right of free assembly and to train people in the exercise of this most<br>
fundamental civic activity.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The right of free assembly has been politically recognized and culturally accepted. We<br>
should now understand that this right is curtailed by laws that make some forms of<br>
assembly obligatory. This is especially the case with institutions which conscript<br>
according to age group, class, or sex, and which are very time-consuming. The army is<br>
one example. School is an even more outrageous one.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To deschool means to abolish the power of one person to oblige another person to attend<br>
a meeting. It also means recognizing the right of any person, of any age or sex, to call a<br>
meeting. This right has been drastically diminished by the institutionalization of<br>
meetings. "Meeting" originally referred to the result of an individual's act of gathering.<br>
Now it refers to the institutional product of some agency.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The ability of service institutions to acquire clients has far outgrown the ability of<br>
individuals to be heard independently of institutional media, which respond to individuals<br>
only if they are salable news. Peer-matching facilities should be available for individuals<br>
who want to bring people together as easily as the village bell called the villagers to<br>
council. School buildings— of doubtful value for conversion to other uses— could often<br>
serve this purpose.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The school system, in fact, may soon face a problem which churches have faced before:<br>
what to do with surplus space emptied by the defection of the faithful. Schools are as<br>
difficult to sell as temples. One way to provide for their continued use would be to give<br>
over the space to people from the neighborhood. Each could state what he would do in</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 66</p></div><div><p dir="auto">the classroom and when, and a bulletin board would bring the available programs to the<br>
attention of the inquirers. Access to "class" would be free-or purchased with educational<br>
vouchers. The "teacher" could even be paid according to the number of pupils he could<br>
attract for any full two-hour period. I can imagine that very young leaders and great<br>
educators would be the two types most prominent in such a system. The same approach<br>
could be taken toward higher education. Students could be furnished with educational<br>
vouchers which entitled them to ten hours' yearly private consultation with the teacher of<br>
their choice— and, for the rest of their learning, depend on the library, the peer-matching<br>
network, and apprenticeships.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">We must, of course, recognize the probability that such public matching devices would<br>
be abused for exploitative and immoral purposes, just as the telephone and the mails have<br>
been so abused. As with those networks, there must be some protection. I have proposed<br>
elsewhere a matching system which would allow only pertinent printed information, plus<br>
the name and address of the inquirer, to be used. Such a system would be virtually<br>
foolproof against abuse. Other arrangements could allow the addition of any book, film,<br>
TV program, or other item quoted from a special catalogue. Concern about the dangers of<br>
the system should not make us lose sight of its far greater benefits.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Some who share my concern for free speech and assembly will argue that peer-matching<br>
is an artificial means of bringing people together and would not be used by the poor— who<br>
need it most. Some people become genuinely agitated when one suggests the setting up<br>
of ad hoc encounters which are not rooted in the life of a local community. Others react<br>
when one suggests using a computer to sort and match client-identified interests. People<br>
cannot be drawn together in such an impersonal manner, they say. Common inquiry must<br>
be rooted in a history of shared experience at many levels, and must grow out of this<br>
experience-the development of neighborhood institutions, for example.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">I sympathize with these objections, but I think they miss my point as well as their own. In<br>
the first place, the return to neighborhood life as the primary center of creative expression<br>
might actually work against the re-establishment of neighborhoods as political units.<br>
Centering demands on the neighborhood may, in fact, neglect an important liberating<br>
aspect of urban life— the ability of a person to participate simultaneously in several peer<br>
groups. Also, there is an important sense in which people who have never lived together<br>
in a physical community, may occasionally have far more experiences to share than those<br>
who have known each other from childhood. The great religions have always recognized<br>
the importance of far-off encounters, and the faithful have always found freedom through<br>
them; pilgrimage, monasticism, the mutual support of temples and sanctuaries reflect this<br>
awareness. Peer-matching could significantly help in making explicit the many potential<br>
but suppressed communities of the city.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Local communities are valuable. They are also a vanishing reality as men progressively<br>
let service institutions define their circles of social relationship. Milton Kotler in his<br>
recent book has shown that the imperialism of "downtown" deprives the neighborhood of<br>
its political significance. The protectionist attempt to resurrect the neighborhood as a<br>
cultural unit only supports this bureaucratic imperialism. Far from artificially removing</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 67</p></div><div><p dir="auto">men from their local contexts to join abstract groupings, peer-matching should encourage<br>
the restoration of local life to cities from which it is now disappearing. A man who<br>
recovers his initiative to call his fellows into meaningful conversation may cease to settle<br>
for being separated from them by office protocol or suburban etiquette. Having once seen<br>
that doing things together depends on deciding to do so, men may even insist that their<br>
local communities become more open to creative political exchange.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">We must recognize that city life tends to become immensely costly as city-dwellers must<br>
be taught to rely for every one of their needs on complex institutional services. It is<br>
extremely expensive to keep it even minimally livable. Peer-matching in the city could be<br>
a first step toward breaking down the dependence of citizens on bureaucratic civic<br>
services.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">It would also be an essential step to providing new means of establishing public trust. In a<br>
schooled society we have come to rely more and more on the professional judgment of<br>
educators on the effect of their own work in order to decide whom we can or cannot trust:<br>
we go to the doctor, lawyer, or psychologist because we trust that anybody with the<br>
required amount of specialized educational treatment by other colleagues deserves our<br>
confidence.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In a deschooled society professionals could no longer claim the trust of their clients on<br>
the basis of their curricular pedigree, or ensure their standing by simply referring their<br>
clients to other professionals who approved of their schooling. Instead of placing trust in<br>
professionals, it should be possible, at any time, for any potential client to consult with<br>
other experienced clients of a professional about their satisfaction with him by means of<br>
another peer network easily set up by computer, or by a number of other means. Such<br>
networks could be seen as public utilities which permitted students to choose their<br>
teachers or patients their healers.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Professional Educators</p></div><div><p dir="auto">As citizens have new choices, new chances for learning, their willingness to seek<br>
leadership should increase. We may expect that they will experience more deeply both<br>
their own independence and their need for guidance. As they are liberated from<br>
manipulation by others, they should learn to profit from the discipline others have<br>
acquired in a lifetime. Deschooling education should increase— rather than stifle— the<br>
search for men with practical wisdom who would be willing to sustain the newcomer in<br>
his educational adventure. As masters of their art abandon the claim to be superior<br>
informants or skill models, their claim to superior wisdom will begin to ring true.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">With an increasing demand for masters, their supply should also increase. As the<br>
schoolmaster vanishes, conditions will arise which should bring forth the vocation of the<br>
independent educator. This may seem almost a contradiction in terms, so thoroughly have<br>
schools and teachers become complementary. Yet this is exactly what the development of<br>
the first three educational exchanges would tend to result in— and what would be required</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 68</p></div><div><p dir="auto">to permit their full exploitation— for parents and other '"natural educators" need guidance,<br>
individual learners need assistance, and the networks need people to operate them.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Parents need guidance in directing their children on the road that leads to responsible<br>
educational independence. Learners need experienced leadership when they encounter<br>
rough terrain. These two needs are quite distinct: the first is a need for pedagogy, the<br>
second for intellectual leadership in all other fields of knowledge. The first calls for<br>
knowledge of human learning and of educational resources, the second for wisdom based<br>
on experience in any kind of exploration. Both kinds of experience are indispensable for<br>
effective educational endeavor. Schools package these functions into one role— and<br>
render the independent exercise of any of them if not disreputable at least suspect.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Three types of special educational competence should, in fact, be distinguished: one to<br>
create and operate the kinds of educational exchanges or networks outlined here; another<br>
to guide students and parents in the use of these networks; and a third to act as primus<br>
inter pares in undertaking difficult intellectual exploratory journeys. Only the former two<br>
can be conceived of as branches of an independent profession: educational administrators<br>
and pedagogical counselors. To design and operate the networks I have been describing<br>
would not require many people, but it would require people with the most profound<br>
understanding of education and administration, in a perspective quite different from and<br>
even opposed to that of schools.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">While an independent educational profession of this kind would welcome many people<br>
whom the schools exclude, it would also exclude many whom the schools qualify. The<br>
establishment and operation of educational networks would require some designers and<br>
administrators, but not in the numbers or of the type required by the administration of<br>
schools. Student discipline, public relations, hiring, supervising, and firing teachers<br>
would have neither place nor counterpart in the networks I have been describing. Neither<br>
would curriculum-making, textbook-purchasing, the maintenance of grounds and<br>
facilities, or the supervision of interscholastic athletic competition. Nor would child<br>
custody, lesson-planning, and record-keeping, which now take up so much of the time of<br>
teachers, figure in the operation of educational networks. Instead, the operation of<br>
learning webs would require some of the skills and attitudes now expected from the staff<br>
of a museum, a library, an executive employment agency, or a maitre d'h™tel.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Today's educational administrators are concerned with controlling teachers and students<br>
to the satisfaction of others -trustees, legislatures, and corporate executives. Network<br>
builders and administrators would have to demonstrate genius at keeping themselves, and<br>
others, out of people's way, at facilitating en-counters among students, skill models,<br>
educational leaders, and educational objects. Many persons now attracted to teaching are<br>
profoundly authoritarian and would not be able to assume this task: building educational<br>
exchanges would mean making it easy for people— especially the young— to pursue goals<br>
which might contradict the ideals of the traffic manager who makes the pursuit possible.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">If the networks I have described could emerge, the educational path of each student<br>
would be his own to follow, and only in retrospect would it take on the features of a</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 69</p></div><div><p dir="auto">recognizable program. The wise student would periodically seek professional advice:<br>
assistance to set a new goal, insight into difficulties encountered, choice between possible<br>
methods. Even now, most persons would admit that the important services their teachers<br>
have rendered them are such advice or counsel, given at a chance meeting or in a tutorial.<br>
Pedagogues, in an unschooled world, would also come into their own, and be able to do<br>
what frustrated teachers pretend to pursue today.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">While network administrators would concentrate primarily on the building and<br>
maintenance of roads providing access to resources, the pedagogue would help the<br>
student to find the path which for him could lead fastest to his goal. If a student wanted to<br>
learn spoken Cantonese from a Chinese neighbor, the pedagogue would be available to<br>
judge their proficiency, and to help them select the textbook and methods most suitable to<br>
their talents, character, and the time available for study. He could counsel the would-be<br>
airplane mechanic on finding the best places for apprenticeship. He could recommend<br>
books to somebody who wanted to find challenging peers to discuss African history. Like<br>
the network administrator, the pedagogical counselor would conceive of himself as a<br>
professional educator. Access to either could be gained by individuals through the use of<br>
educational vouchers.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The role of the educational initiator or leader, the master or "true" leader, is somewhat<br>
more elusive than that of the professional administrator or the pedagogue. This is so<br>
because leadership is itself hard to define. In practice, an individual is a leader if people<br>
follow his initiative and become apprentices in his progressive discoveries. Frequently,<br>
this involves a prophetic vision of entirely new standards— quite understandable today— in<br>
which present "wrong" will turn out to be "right." In a society which would honor the<br>
right to call assemblies through peer-matching, the ability to take educational initiative on<br>
a specific subject would be as wide as access to learning itself. But, of course, there is a<br>
vast difference between the initiative taken by someone to call a fruitful meeting to<br>
discuss this essay and the ability of someone to provide leadership in the systematic<br>
exploration of its implications.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Leadership also does not depend on being right. As Thomas Kuhn points out, in a period<br>
of constantly changing paradigms most of the very distinguished leaders are bound to be<br>
proven wrong by the test of hindsight. Intellectual leadership does depend on superior<br>
intellectual discipline and imagination and the willingness to associate with others in their<br>
exercise. A learner, for example, may think that there is an analogy between the U.S.<br>
antislavery movement or the Cuban Revolution and what is happening in Harlem. The<br>
educator who is himself a historian can show him how to appreciate the flaws in such an<br>
analogy. He may retrace his own steps as a historian. He may invite the learner to<br>
participate in his own research. In both cases he will apprentice his pupil in a critical art—<br>
which is rare in school— and which money or other favors cannot buy.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The relationship of master and disciple is not restricted to intellectual discipline. It has its<br>
counterpart in the arts, in physics, in religion, in psychoanalysis, and in pedagogy. It fits<br>
mountain-climbing, silverworking and politics, cabinetmaking and personnel<br>
administration. What is common to all true master-pupil relationships is the awareness</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 70</p></div><div><p dir="auto">both share that their relationship is literally priceless and in very different ways a<br>
privilege for both.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Charlatans, demagogues, proselytizers, corrupt masters, and simoniacal priests, tricksters,<br>
miracle workers, and messiahs have proven capable of assuming leadership roles and<br>
thus show the dangers of any dependence of a disciple on the master. Different societies<br>
have taken different measures to defend themselves against these counterfeit teachers.<br>
Indians relied on caste-lineage, Eastern Jews on the spiritual discipleship of rabbis, high<br>
periods of Christianity on an exemplary life of monastic virtue, other periods on<br>
hierarchical orders. Our society relies on certification by schools. It is doubtful that this<br>
procedure provides a better screening, but if it should be claimed that it does, then the<br>
counterclaim can be made that it does so at the cost of making personal discipleship<br>
almost vanish.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In practice, there will always be a fuzzy line between the teacher of skills and the<br>
educational leaders identified above, and there are no practical reasons why access to<br>
some leaders could not be gained by discovering the "master" in the drill teacher who<br>
introduces students to his discipline.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">On the other hand, what characterizes the true master-disciple relationship is its priceless<br>
character. Aristotle speaks of it as a ""moral type of friendship, which is not on fixed<br>
terms: it makes a gift, or does whatever it does, as to a friend." Thomas Aquinas says of<br>
this kind of teaching that inevitably it is an act of love and mercy. This kind of teaching is<br>
always a luxury for the teacher and a form of leisure (in Greek, "scliole") for him and his<br>
pupil: an activity meaningful for both, having no ulterior purpose.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To rely for true intellectual leadership on the desire of gifted people to provide it is<br>
obviously necessary even in our society, but it could not be made into a policy now. We<br>
must first construct a society in which personal acts themselves reacquire a value higher<br>
than that of making things and manipulating people. In such a society exploratory,<br>
inventive, creative teaching would logically be counted among the most desirable forms<br>
of leisurely "unemployment." But we do not have to wait until the advent of utopia. Even<br>
now one of the most important consequences of deschooling and the establishment of<br>
peer-matching facilities would be the initiative which "masters" could take to assemble<br>
congenial disciples. It would also, as we have seen, provide ample opportunity for<br>
potential disciples to share information or to select a master.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Schools are not the only institutions which pervert professions by packaging roles.<br>
Hospitals render home care increasingly impossible— and then justify hospitalization as a<br>
benefit to the sick. At the same time, the doctor's legitimacy and ability to work come<br>
increasingly to depend on his association with a hospital, even though he is still less<br>
totally dependent on it than are teachers on schools. The same could be said about courts,<br>
which overcrowd their calendars as new transactions acquire legal solemnity, and thus<br>
delay justice. Or it could be said about churches, which succeed in making a captive<br>
profession out of a free vocation. The result in each case is scarce service at higher cost,<br>
and greater income to the less competent members of the profession.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 71</p></div><div><p dir="auto">So long as the older professions monopolize superior income and prestige it is difficult to<br>
reform them. The profession of the schoolteacher should be easier to reform, and not only<br>
because it is of more recent origin. The educational profession now claims a<br>
comprehensive monopoly; it claims the exclusive competence to apprentice not only its<br>
own novices but those of other professions as well. This overexpansion renders it<br>
vulnerable to any profession which would reclaim the right to teach its own apprentices.<br>
Schoolteachers are overwhelmingly badly paid and frustrated by the tight control of the<br>
school system. The most enterprising and gifted among them would probably find more<br>
congenial work, more independence, and even higher incomes by specializing as skill<br>
models, network administrators, or guidance specialists.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Finally, the dependence of the registered student on the certified teacher can be broken<br>
more easily than his dependence on other professionals— for instance, that of a<br>
hospitalized patient on his doctor. If schools ceased to be compulsory, teachers who find<br>
their satisfaction in the exercise of pedagogical authority in the classroom would be left<br>
only with pupils who were attracted by their style. The disestablishment of our present<br>
professional structure could begin with the dropping out of the schoolteacher.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The disestablishment of schools will inevitably happen— and it will happen surprisingly<br>
fast. It cannot be retarded very much longer, and it is hardly necessary to promote it<br>
vigorously, for this is being done now. What is worthwhile is to try to orient it in a<br>
hopeful direction, for it could take place in either of two diametrically opposed ways.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The first would be the expansion of the mandate of the pedagogue and his increasing<br>
control over society even outside school. With the best of intentions and simply by<br>
expanding the rhetoric now used in school, the present crisis in the schools could provide<br>
educators with an excuse to use all the networks of contemporary society to funnel their<br>
messages to us— for our own good. Deschooling, which we cannot stop, could mean the<br>
advent of a ""brave new world" dominated by well-intentioned administrators of<br>
programmed instruction.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">On the other hand, the growing awareness on the part of governments, as well as of<br>
employers, taxpayers, enlightened pedagogues, and school administrators, that graded<br>
curricular teaching for certification has become harmful could offer large masses of<br>
people an extraordinary opportunity: that of preserving the right of equal access to the<br>
tools both of learning and of sharing with others what they know or believe. But this<br>
would require that the educational revolution be guided by certain goals:</p></div><div><p dir="auto">1 . To liberate access to things by abolishing the control which persons and institutions<br>
now exercise over their educational values.</p></div><div><ol start="2">
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">To liberate the sharing of skills by guaranteeing freedom to teach or exercise them on<br>
request.</li>
</ol></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 72</p></div><div><ol start="3">
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">
<p>To liberate the critical and creative resources of people by returning to individual<br>
persons the ability to call and hold meetings— an ability now increasingly monopolized by<br>
institutions which claim to speak for the people.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto">
<p>To liberate the individual from the obligation to shape his expectations to the services<br>
offered by any established profession— by providing him with the opportunity to draw on<br>
the experience of his peers and to entrust himself to the teacher, guide, adviser, or healer<br>
of his choice. Inevitably the deschooling of society will blur the distinctions between<br>
economics, education, and politics on which the stability of the present world order and<br>
the stability of nations now rest.</p>
</li>
</ol></div><div><p dir="auto">Our review of educational institutions leads us to a review of our image of man. The<br>
creature whom schools need as a client has neither the autonomy nor the motivation to<br>
grow on his own. We can recognize universal schooling as the culmination of a<br>
Promethean enterprise, and speak about the alternative as a world fit to live in for<br>
Epimethean man. While we can specify that the alternative to scholastic funnels is a<br>
world made transparent by true communication webs, and while we can specify very<br>
concretely how these could function, we can only expect the Epimethean nature of man<br>
to re-emerge; we can neither plan nor produce it.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 73</p></div><div><p dir="auto">7</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Rebirth of Epimethean Man</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Our society resembles the ultimate machine which I once saw in a New York toy shop. It<br>
was a metal casket which, when you touched a switch, snapped open to reveal a<br>
mechanical hand. Chromed fingers reached out for the lid, pulled it down, and locked it<br>
from the inside. It was a box; you expected to be able to take something out of it; yet all it<br>
contained was a mechanism for closing the cover. This contraption is the opposite of<br>
Pandora's "box."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The original Pandora, the All-Giver, was an Earth goddess in prehistoric matriarchal<br>
Greece. She let all ills escape from her amphora (pythos). But she closed the lid before<br>
Hope could escape. The history of modem man begins with the degradation of Pandora's<br>
myth and comes to an end in the self-sealing casket. It is the history of the Promethean<br>
endeavor to forge institutions in order to corral each of the rampant ills. It is the history of<br>
fading hope and rising expectations.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To understand what this means we must rediscover the distinction between hope and<br>
expectation. Hope, in its strong sense, means trusting faith in the goodness of nature,<br>
while expectation, as I will use it here, means reliance on results which are planned and<br>
controlled by man. Hope centers desire on a person from whom we await a gift.<br>
Expectation looks forward to satisfaction from a predictable process which will produce<br>
what we have the right to claim. The Promethean ethos has now eclipsed hope. Survival<br>
of the human race depends on its rediscovery as a social force.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The original Pandora was sent to Earth with ajar which contained all ills; of good things,<br>
it contained only hope. Primitive man lived in this world of hope. He relied on the<br>
munificence of nature, on the handouts of gods, and on the instincts of his tribe to enable<br>
him to subsist. Classical Greeks began to replace hope with expectations. In their version<br>
of Pandora she released both evils and goods. They remembered her mainly for the ills<br>
she had unleashed. And, most significantly, they forgot that the All-Giver was also the<br>
keeper of hope.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Greeks told the story of two brothers, Prometheus and Epimetheus. The former<br>
warned the latter to leave Pandora alone. Instead, he married her. In classical Greece the<br>
name "Epimetheus," which means "hindsight," was interpreted to mean "dull" or "dumb."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 74</p></div><div><p dir="auto">By the time Hesiod retold the story in its classical form, the Greeks had become moral<br>
and misogynous patriarchs who panicked at the thought of the first woman. They built a<br>
rational and authoritarian society. Men engineered institutions through which they<br>
planned to cope with the rampant ills. They became conscious of their power to fashion<br>
the world and make it produce services they also learned to expect. They wanted their<br>
own needs and the future demands of their children to be shaped by their artifacts. They<br>
became lawgivers, architects, and authors, the makers of constitutions, cities, and works<br>
of art to serve as examples for their offspring. Primitive man had relied on mythical<br>
participation in sacred rites to initiate individuals into the lore of society, but the classical<br>
Greeks recognized as true men only those citizens who let themselves be fitted by<br>
paidela (education) into the institutions their elders had planned.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The developing myth reflects the transition from a world in which dreams were<br>
interpreted to a world in which oracles were made. From immemorial time, the Earth<br>
Goddess had been worshipped on the slope of Mount Parnassus, which was the center<br>
and navel of the Earth. There, at Delphi (from deiphys, the womb), slept Gaia, the sister<br>
of Chaos and Eros. Her son, Python the dragon, guarded her moonlit and dewy dreams,<br>
until Apollo the Sun God, the architect of Troy, rose from the east, slew the dragon, and<br>
became the owner of Gaia's cave. His priests took over her temple. They employed a<br>
local maiden, sat her on a tripod over Earth's smoking navel, and made her drowsy with<br>
fumes. They then rhymed her ecstatic utterances into hexameters of self-fulfilling<br>
prophecies. From all over the Peloponnesus men brought their problems to Apollo's<br>
sanctuary. The oracle was consulted on social options, such as measures to be taken to<br>
stop a plague or a famine, to choose the right constitution for Sparta or the propitious<br>
sites for cities which later became Byzantium and Chalcedon. The never-erring arrow<br>
became Apollo's symbol. Everything about him became purposeful and useful.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In the Republic, describing the ideal state, Plato already excludes popular music. Only the<br>
harp and Apollo's lyre would be permitted in towns because their harmony alone creates<br>
"the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the strain of the unfortunate and the<br>
strain of the fortunate, the strain of courage and the strain of temperance which befit the<br>
citizen." City-dwellers panicked before Pan's flute and its power to awaken the instincts.<br>
Only "the shepherds may play [Pan's] pipes and they only in the country."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Man assumed responsibility for the laws under which he wanted to live and for the<br>
casting of the environment into his own image. Primitive initiation by Mother Earth into<br>
mythical life was transformed into the education (paideia) of the citizen who would feel<br>
at home in the forum.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To the primitive the world was governed by fate, fact, and necessity. By stealing fire<br>
from the gods, Prometheus turned facts into problems, called necessity into question, and<br>
defied fate. Classical man framed a civilized context for human perspective. He was<br>
aware that he could defy fate-nature-environment, but only at his own risk. Contemporary<br>
man goes further; he attempts to create the world in his image, to build a totally man-<br>
made environment, and then discovers that he can do so only on the condition of</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 75</p></div><div><p dir="auto">constantly remaking himself to fit it. We now must face the fact that man himself is at<br>
stake.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Life today in New York produces a very peculiar vision of what is and what can be, and<br>
without this vision life in New York is impossible. A child on the streets of New York<br>
never touches anything which has not been scientifically developed, engineered, planned,<br>
and sold to someone. Even the trees are there because the Parks Department decided to<br>
put them there. The jokes the child hears on television have been programmed at a high<br>
cost. The refuse with which he plays in the streets of Harlem is made of broken packages<br>
planned for somebody else. Even desires and fears are institutionally shaped. Power and<br>
violence are organized and managed: the gangs versus the police. Learning itself is<br>
defined as the consumption of subject matter, which is the result of researched, planned,<br>
and promoted programs. Whatever good there is, is the product of some specialized<br>
institution. It would be foolish to demand something which some institution cannot<br>
produce. The child of the city cannot expect anything which lies outside the possible<br>
development of institutional process. Even his fantasy is prompted to produce science<br>
fiction. He can experience the poetic surprise of the unplanned only through his<br>
encounter with "dirt," blunder, or failure: the orange peel in the gutter, the puddle in the<br>
street, the breakdown of order, program, or machine are the only take-offs for creative<br>
fancy. "Goofing off" becomes the only poetry at hand.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Since there is nothing desirable which has not been planned, the city child soon<br>
concludes that we will always be able to design an institution for our every want. He<br>
takes for granted the power of process to create value. Whether the goal is meeting a<br>
mate, integrating a neighborhood, or acquiring reading skills, it will be defined in such a<br>
way that its achievement can be engineered. The man who knows that nothing in demand<br>
is out of production soon expects that nothing produced can be out of demand. If a moon<br>
vehicle can be designed, so can the demand to go to the moon. Not to go where one can<br>
go would be subversive. It would unmask as folly the assumption that every satisfied<br>
demand entails the discovery of an even greater unsatisfied one. Such insight would stop<br>
progress. Not to produce what is possible would expose the law of "rising expectations"<br>
as a euphemism for a growing frustration gap, which is the motor of a society built on the<br>
coproduction of services and increased demand.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The state of mind of the modem city-dweller appears in the mythical tradition only under<br>
the image of Hell: Sisyphus, who for a while had chained Thanatos (death), must roll a<br>
heavy stone up the hill to the pinnacle of Hell, and the stone always slips from his grip<br>
just when he is about to reach the top. Tantalus, who was invited by the gods to share<br>
their meal, and on that occasion stole their secret of how to prepare all-healing ambrosia,<br>
which bestowed immortality, suffers eternal hunger and thirst standing in a river of<br>
receding waters, overshadowed by fruit trees with receding branches. A world of ever-<br>
rising demands is not just evil-it can be spoken of only as Hell.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Man has developed the frustrating power to demand anything because he cannot visualize<br>
anything which an institution cannot do for him. Surrounded by all-powerful tools, man<br>
is reduced to a tool of his tools. Each of the institutions meant to exorcise one of the</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page #76</p></div><div><p dir="auto">primeval evils has become a fail-safe, self-sealing coffin for man. Man is trapped in the<br>
boxes he makes to contain the ills Pandora allowed to escape. The blackout of reality in<br>
the smog produced by our tools has enveloped us. Quite suddenly we find ourselves in<br>
the darkness of our own trap.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Reality itself has become dependent on human decision. The same President who ordered<br>
the ineffective invasion of Cambodia could equally well order the effective use of the<br>
atom. The "Hiroshima switch" now can cut the navel of the Earth. Man has acquired the<br>
power to make Chaos overwhelm both Eros and Gaia. This new power of man to cut the<br>
navel of the Earth is a constant reminder that our institutions not only create their own<br>
ends, but also have the power to put an end to themselves and to us. The absurdity of<br>
modern institutions is evident in the case of the military. Modem weapons can defend<br>
freedom, civilization, and life only by annihilating them. Security in military language<br>
means the ability to do away with the Earth.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The absurdity that underlies nonmilitary institutions is no less manifest. There is no<br>
switch in them to activate their destructive power, but neither do they need a switch.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Their grip is already fastened to the lid of the world. They create needs faster than they<br>
can create satisfaction, and in the process of trying to meet the needs they generate, they<br>
consume the Earth. This is true for agriculture and manufacturing, and no less for<br>
medicine and education. Modem agriculture poisons and exhausts the soil. The "green<br>
revolution" can, by means of new seeds, triple the output of an acre— but only with an<br>
even greater proportional increase of fertilizers, insecticides, water, and power.<br>
Manufacturing of these, as of all other goods, pollutes the oceans and the atmosphere and<br>
degrades irreplaceable resources. If combustion continues to increase at present rates, we<br>
will soon consume the oxygen of the atmosphere faster than it can be replaced. We have<br>
no reason to believe that fission or fusion can replace combustion without equal or higher<br>
hazards. Medicine men replace midwives and promise to make man into something else:<br>
genetically planned, pharmacologically sweetened, and capable of more protracted<br>
sickness. The contemporary ideal is a pan-hygienic world: a world in which all contacts<br>
between men, and between men and their world, are the result of foresight and<br>
manipulation. School has become the planned process which tools man for a planned<br>
world, the principal tool to trap man in man s trap. It is sup-posed to shape each man to<br>
an adequate level for playing a part in this world game. Inexorably we cultivate, treat,<br>
produce, and school the world out of existence.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The military institution is evidently absurd. The absurdity of nonmilitary institutions is<br>
more difficult to face. It is even more frightening, precisely because it operates<br>
inexorably. We know which switch must stay open to avoid an atomic holocaust. No<br>
switch detains an ecological Armageddon.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In classical antiquity, man had discovered that the world could be made according to<br>
man's plans, and with this insight he perceived that it was inherently precarious, dramatic<br>
and comical. Democratic institutions evolved and man was presumed worthy of trust<br>
within their framework. Expectations from due process and confidence in human nature</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 77</p></div><div><p dir="auto">kept each other in balance. The traditional professions developed and with them the<br>
institutions needed for their exercise.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Surreptitiously, reliance on institutional process has replaced dependence on personal<br>
good will. The world has lost its humane dimension and reacquired the factual necessity<br>
and fatefulness which were characteristic of primitive times. But while the chaos of the<br>
barbarian was constantly ordered in the name of mysterious, anthropomorphic gods,<br>
today only man's planning can be given as a reason for the world being as it, is. Man has<br>
become the plaything of scientists, engineers, and planners.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">We see this logic at work in ourselves and in others. I know a Mexican village through<br>
which not more than a dozen cars drive each day. A Mexican was playing dominoes on<br>
the new hard-surface road in front of his house— where he had probably played and sat<br>
since his youth. A car sped through and killed him. The tourist who reported the event to<br>
me was deeply upset, and yet he said: "The man had it coming to him."</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At first sight, the tourist's remark is no different from the statement of some primitive<br>
bushman reporting the death of a fellow who had collided with a taboo and had therefore<br>
died. But the two statements carry opposite meanings. The primitive can blame some<br>
tremendous and dumb transcendence, while the tourist is in awe of the inexorable logic of<br>
the machine. The primitive does not sense responsibility; the tourist senses it, but denies<br>
it. In both the primitive and the tourist the classical mode of drama, the style of tragedy,<br>
the logic of personal endeavor and rebellion is absent. The primitive man has not become<br>
conscious of it, and the tourist has lost it. The myth of the Bushman and the myth of the<br>
American are made of inert, inhuman forces. Neither experiences tragic rebellion. For the<br>
Bushman, the event follows the laws of magic; for the American, it follows the laws of<br>
science. The event puts him under the spell of the laws of mechanics, which for him<br>
govern physical, social, and psychological events.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The mood of 1971 is propitious for a major change of direction in search of a hopeful<br>
future. Institutional goals continuously contradict institutional products. The poverty<br>
program produces more poor, the war in Asia more Vietcong, technical assistance more<br>
underdevelopment. Birth control clinics increase survival rates and boost the population;<br>
schools produce more dropouts; and the curb on one kind of pollution usually increases<br>
another.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Consumers are faced with the realization that the more they can buy, the more deceptions<br>
they must swallow. Until recently it seemed logical that the blame for this pandemic<br>
inflation of dysfunctions could be laid either on the limping of scientific discovery behind<br>
the technological demands or on the perversity of ethnic, ideological, or class enemies.<br>
Both the expectations of a scientific millennium and of a war to end all wars have<br>
declined.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">For the experienced consumer, there is no way back to a na*vc reliance on magical<br>
technologies. Too many people have had bad experiences with neurotic computers,<br>
hospital-bred infections, and jams wherever there is traffic on the road, in the air, or on</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page# 78</p></div><div><p dir="auto">the phone. Only ten years ago conventional wisdom anticipated a better life based on an<br>
increase in scientific discovery. Now scientists frighten children. The moon shots provide<br>
a fascinating demonstration that human failure can be almost eliminated among the<br>
operators of complex systems-yet this does not allay our fears that the human failure to<br>
consume according to instruction might spread out of control.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">For the social reformer there is no way back, either, to the assumptions of the forties. The<br>
hope has vanished that the problem of justly distributing goods can be sidetracked by<br>
creating an abundance of them. The cost of the minimum package capable of satisfying<br>
modern tastes has skyrocketed, and what makes tastes modern is their obsolescence prior<br>
even to satisfaction.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The limits of the Earth's resources have become evident. No breakthrough in science or<br>
technology could provide every man in the world with the commodities and services<br>
which are now available to the poor of rich countries. For instance, it would take the<br>
extraction of one hundred times the present amounts of iron, tin, copper, and lead to<br>
achieve such a goal, with even the "lightest" alternative technology.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Finally, teachers, doctors, and social workers realize that their distinct professional<br>
ministrations have one aspect-at least-in common. They create further demands for the<br>
institutional treatments they provide, faster than they can provide service institutions.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Not just some part, but the very logic, of conventional wisdom is becoming suspect. Even<br>
the laws of economy seem unconvincing outside the narrow parameters which apply to<br>
the social, geographic area where most of the money is concentrated. Money is, indeed,<br>
the cheapest currency, but only in an economy geared to efficiency measured in monetary<br>
terms. Both capitalist and Communist countries in their various forms are committed to<br>
measuring efficiency in cost-benefit ratios expressed in dollars. Capitalism flaunts a<br>
higher standard of living as its claim to superiority. Communism boasts of a higher<br>
growth rate as an index of its ultimate triumph. But under either ideology the total cost of<br>
increasing efficiency increases geometrically. The largest institutions compete most<br>
fiercely for resources which are not listed in any inventory: the air, the ocean, silence,<br>
sunlight, and health. They bring the scarcity of these resources to public attention only<br>
when they are almost irremediably degraded. Everywhere nature becomes poisonous,<br>
society inhumane, and the inner life is invaded and personal vocation smothered.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">A society committed to the institutionalization of values identifies the production of<br>
goods and services with the demand for such. Education which makes you need the<br>
product is included in the price of the product. School is the advertising agency which<br>
makes you believe that you need the society as it is. In such a society marginal value has<br>
become constantly self-transcendent. It forces the few largest consumers to compete for<br>
the power to deplete the earth, to fill their own swelling bellies, to discipline smaller<br>
consumers, and to deactivate those who still find satisfaction in making do with what<br>
they have. The ethos of nonsatiety is thus at the root of physical depredation, social<br>
polarization, and psychological passivity.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 79</p></div><div><p dir="auto">When values have been institutionalized in planned and engineered processes, members<br>
of modern society believe that the good life consists in having institutions which define<br>
the values that both they and their society believe they need. Institutional value can be<br>
defined as the level of output of an institution. The corresponding value of man is<br>
measured by his ability to consume and degrade these institutional outputs, and thus<br>
create a new-even higher-demand. The value of institutionalized man depends on his<br>
capacity as an incinerator. To use an image— he has become the idol of his handiworks.<br>
Man now defines himself as the fur-nace which bums up the values produced by his<br>
tools. And there is no limit to his capacity. His is the act of Prometheus carried to an<br>
extreme.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The exhaustion and pollution of the earth's resources is, above all, the result of a<br>
corruption in man's self-image, of a regression in his consciousness. Some would like to<br>
speak about a mutation of collective consciousness which leads to a conception of man as<br>
an organism dependent not on nature and individuals, but rather on institutions. This<br>
institutionalization of substantive values, this belief that a planned process of treatment<br>
ultimately gives results desired by the recipient, this consumer ethos, is at the heart of the<br>
Promethean fallacy.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Efforts to find a new balance in the global milieu depend on the deinstitutionalization of<br>
values.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The suspicion that something is structurally wrong with the vision of homo faber is<br>
common to a growing minority in capitalist, Communist, and "underdeveloped" countries<br>
alike. This suspicion is the shared characteristic of a new elite. To it belong people of all<br>
classes, incomes, faiths, and civilizations. They have 'become wary of the myths of the<br>
majority: of scientific utopias, of ideological diabolism, and of the expectation of the<br>
distribution of goods and services with some degree of equality. They share with the<br>
majority the sense of being trapped. They share with the majority the awareness that most<br>
new policies adopted by broad consensus consistently lead to results which are glaringly<br>
opposed to their stated aims. Yet whereas the Promethean majority of would-be<br>
spacemen still evades the structural issue, the emergent minority is critical of the<br>
scientific dens ex mach ina, the ideological panacea, and the hunt for devils and witches.<br>
This minority begins to formulate its suspicion that our constant deceptions tie us to<br>
contemporary institutions as the chains bound Prometheus to his rock. Hopeful trust and<br>
classical irony (eironeia) must conspire to expose the Promethean fallacy. Prometheus is<br>
usually thought to mean "foresight," or sometimes even "he who makes the North Star<br>
progress." He tricked the gods out of their monopoly of fire, taught men to use it in the<br>
forging of iron, became the god of technologists, and wound up in iron chains.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The Pythia of Delphi has now been replaced by a computer which hovers above panels<br>
and punch cards. The hexameters of the oracle have given way to sixteen-bit codes of<br>
instructions. Man the helmsman has turned the rudder over to the cybernetic machine.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The ultimate machine emerges to direct our destinies. Children phantasize flying their<br>
spacecrafts away from a crepuscular earth.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Deschooling Society</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Page # 80</p></div><div><p dir="auto">From the perspectives of the Man on the Moon, Prometheus could recognize sparkling<br>
blue Gaia as the planet of Hope and as the Arc of Mankind. A new sense of the finiteness<br>
of the Earth and a new nostalgia now can open man's eyes to the choice of his brother<br>
Epimetheus to wed the Earth with Pandora.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">At this point the Greek myth turns into hopeful prophecy because it tells us that the son<br>
of Prometheus was Deucalion, the Helmsman of the Ark who like Noah outrode the<br>
Flood to become the father of a new mankind which he made from the earth with Pyrrha,<br>
the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora. We are gaining insight into the meaning of the<br>
Pythos which Pandora brought from the gods as being the inverse of the Box: our Vessel<br>
and Ark.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">We now need a name for those who value hope above expectations. We need a name for<br>
those who love people more than products, those who believe that</p></div><div><p dir="auto">No people are uninteresting. Their fate is<br>
like the chronicle of planets. Nothing in<br>
them is not particular, and planet is<br>
dissimilar from planet.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">We need a name for those who love the earth on which each can meet the other,</p></div><div><p dir="auto">And if a man lived in obscurity making his<br>
friends in that obscurity, obscurity is not<br>

of the fire and the shaping of iron, but who do so to enhance their ability to tend and care<br>
