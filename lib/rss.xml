Until we first met in Puerto Rico<br>
in 1958, 1 had never questioned the value of extending obligatory schooling to all people.<br>
Together we have come to realize that for most men the right to learn is curtailed by the<br>
obligation to attend school. The essays given at CIDOC and gathered in this book grew<br>
out of memoranda which I submitted to him, and which we discussed during 1970, the<br>
thirteenth year of our dialogue. The last chapter contains my afterthoughts on a<br>
conversation with Erich Fromm on Bachofen's Mutterrecht.<br>Since 1967 Reimer and I have met regularly at the Center for Intercultural<br>
Documentation (CIDOC) in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Valentine Borremans, the director of<br>
the Center, also joined our dialogue, and constantly urged me to test our thinking against<br>
the realities of Latin America and Africa. This book reflects her conviction that the ethos,<br>
not just the institutions, of society ought to be "deschooled."<br>Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it<br>
were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools.<br>
Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational<br>
hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the<br>
pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal<br>
education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the<br>
search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for<br>
each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring.<br>
We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research<br>
on education— and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service<br>
industries.<br>On Wednesday mornings, during the spring and summer of 1970, 1 submitted the various<br>
parts of this book to the participants in our CIDOC programs in Cuernavaca. Dozens of<br>
them made suggestions or provided criticisms. Many will recognize their ideas in these<br>
pages, especially Paulo Freire, Peter Berger, and JosZ Maria Bulnes, as well as Joseph<br>
Fitzpatrick, John Holt, Angel Quintero, Layman Allen, Fred Goodman, Gerhard Ladner,<br>
Didier Piveteau, Joel Spring, Augusto Salazar Bondy, and Dennis Sullivan. Among my<br>
critics, Paul Goodman most radically obliged me to revise my thinking. Robert Silvers<br>
provided me with brilliant editorial assistance on Chapters 1, 3, and 6, which have<br>
appeared in The New York Review of Books.<br>Reimer and I have decided to publish separate views of our joint research. He is working<br>
on a comprehensive and documented exposition, which will be subjected to several<br>
months of further critical appraisal and be published late in 1971 by Doubleday &amp;<br>
Company. Dennis Sullivan, who acted as secretary at the meetings between Reimer and<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 2<br>myself, is preparing a book for publication in the spring of 1972 which will place my<br>
argument in the context of current debate about public schooling in the United States. I<br>
offer this volume of essays now in the hope that it will provoke additional critical<br>
contributions to the sessions of a seminar on "Alternatives in Education" planned at<br>
CIDOC in Cuernavaca for 1972 and 1973.<br>I intend to discuss some perplexing issues which are raised once we embrace the<br>
hypothesis that society can be deschooled; to search for criteria which may help us<br>
distinguish institutions which merit development because they support learning in a<br>
deschooled milieu; and to clarify those personal goals which would foster the advent of<br>
an Age of Leisure (schole) as opposed to an economy dominated by service industries.<br>IVAN ILLICH<br>CIDOC<br>Cuernavaca, Mexico<br>
November, 1970<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 3<br>1<br>Why We Must Disestablish School<br>Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what the schools do for<br>
them. They school them to confuse process and substance. Once these become blurred, a<br>
new logic is assumed: the more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation<br>
leads to success. The pupil is thereby "schooled" to confuse teaching with learning, grade<br>
advancement with education, a diploma with competence, and fluency with the ability to<br>
say something new. His imagination is "schooled" to accept service in place of value.<br>
Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the improvement of<br>
community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national security, the rat<br>
race for productive work. Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavor<br>
are defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which claim to serve<br>
these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on allocating more resources to the<br>
management of hospitals, schools, and other agencies in question.<br>In these essays, I will show that the institutionalization of values leads inevitably to<br>
physical pollution, social polarization, and psychological impotence: three dimensions in<br>
a process of global degradation and modernized misery. I will explain how this process of<br>
degradation is accelerated when nonmaterial needs are transformed into demands for<br>
commodities; when health, education, personal mobility, welfare, or psychological<br>
healing are defined as the result of services or "treatments." I do this because I believe<br>
that most of the research now going on about the future tends to advocate further<br>
increases in the institutionalization of values and that we must define conditions which<br>
would permit precisely the contrary to happen. We need research on the possible use of<br>
technology to create institutions which serve personal, creative, and autonomous<br>
interaction and the emergence of values which cannot be substantially controlled by<br>
technocrats. We need counterfoil research to current futurology.<br>I want to raise the general question of the mutual definition of man's nature and the<br>
nature of modem institutions which characterizes our world view and language. To do so,<br>
I have chosen the school as my paradigm, and I therefore deal only indirectly with other<br>
bureaucratic agencies of the corporate state: the consumer-family, the party, the army, the<br>
church, the media. My analysis of the hidden curriculum of school should make it evident<br>
that public education would profit from the deschooling of society, just as family life,<br>
politics, security, faith, and communication would profit from an analogous process.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 4<br>I begin my analysis, in this first essay, by trying to convey what the deschooling of a<br>
schooled society might mean. In this context, it should be easier to understand my choice<br>
of the five specific aspects relevant to this process with which I deal in the subsequent<br>
chapters.<br>Not only education but social reality itself has become schooled. It costs roughly the<br>
same to school both rich and poor in the same dependency. The yearly expenditure per<br>
pupil in the slums and in the rich suburbs of any one of twenty U.S. cities lies in the same<br>
range-and sometimes is favorable to the poor. [?* Penrose B. Jackson, Trends in<br>
Elementary and Secondary Education Expenditures: Central City and Suburban<br>
Comparisons 1965 to 1968, U.S. Office of Education, Office of Program and Planning<br>
Evaluation, June 1969] Rich and poor alike depend on schools and hospitals which guide<br>
their lives, form their world view, and define for them what is legitimate and what is not.<br>
Both view doctoring oneself as irresponsible, learning on one's own as unreliable, and<br>
community organization, when not paid for by those in authority, as a form of aggression<br>
or subversion. For both groups the reliance on institutional treatment renders independent<br>
accomplishment suspect. The progressive underdevelopment of self- and community-<br>
reliance is even more typical in Westchester than it is in the northeast of Brazil.<br>
Everywhere not only education but society as a whole needs "deschooling."<br>Welfare bureaucracies claim a professional, political, and financial monopoly over the<br>
social imagination, setting standards of what is valuable and what is feasible. This<br>
monopoly is at the root of the modernization of poverty. Every simple need to which an<br>
institutional answer is found permits the invention of a new class of poor and a new<br>
definition of poverty. Ten years ago in Mexico it was the normal thing to be bom and to<br>
die in one's own home and to be buried by one's friends. Only the soul's needs were taken<br>
care of by the institutional church. Now to begin and end life at home become signs<br>
either of poverty or of special privilege. Dying and death have come under the<br>
institutional management of doctors and undertakers.<br>Once basic needs have been translated by a society into demands for scientifically<br>
produced commodities, poverty is defined by standards which the technocrats can change<br>
at will. Poverty then refers to those who have fallen behind an advertised ideal of<br>
consumption in some important respect. In Mexico the poor are those who lack three<br>
years of schooling, and in New York they are those who lack twelve.<br>The poor have always been socially powerless. The increasing reliance on institutional<br>
care adds a new dimension to their helplessness: psychological impotence, the inability to<br>
fend for themselves. Peasants on the high plateau of the Andes are exploited by the<br>
landlord and the merchant-once they settle in Lima they are, in addition, dependent on<br>
political bosses, and disabled by their lack of schooling. Modernized poverty combines<br>
the lack of power over circumstances with a loss of personal potency. This modernization<br>
of poverty is a world-wide phenomenon, and lies at the root of contemporary<br>
underdevelopment. Of course it appears under different guises in rich and in poor<br>
countries.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 5<br>It is probably most intensely felt in U.S. cities. Nowhere else is poverty treated at greater<br>
cost. Nowhere else does the treatment of poverty produce so much dependence, anger,<br>
frustration, and further demands. And nowhere else should it be so evident that poverty-<br>
once it has become modemized-has become resistant to treatment with dollars alone and<br>
requires an institutional revolution.<br>Today in the United States the black and even the migrant can aspire to a level of<br>
professional treatment which would have been unthinkable two generations ago, and<br>
which seems grotesque to most people in the Third World. For instance, the U.S. poor<br>
can count on a truant officer to return their children to school until they reach seventeen,<br>
or on a doctor to assign them to a hospital bed which costs sixty dollars per day-the<br>
equivalent of three months' income for a majority of the people in the world. But such<br>
care only makes them dependent on more treatment, and renders them increasingly<br>
incapable of organizing their own lives around their own experiences and resources<br>
within their own communities.<br>The poor in the United States are in a unique position to speak about the predicament<br>
which threatens all the poor in a modernizing world. They are making the discovery that<br>
no amount of dollars can remove the inherent destructiveness of welfare institutions, once<br>
the professional hierarchies of these institutions have convinced society that their<br>
ministrations are morally necessary. The poor in the U.S. inner city can demonstrate from<br>
their own experience the fallacy on which social legislation in a "schooled" society is<br>
built.<br>Supreme Court Justice William 0. Douglas observed that "the only way to establish an<br>
institution is to finance it." The corollary is also true. Only by channeling dollars away<br>
from the institutions which now treat health, education, and welfare can the further<br>
impoverishment resulting from their disabling side effects be stopped.<br>This must be kept in mind when we evaluate federal aid pro-grams. As a case in point,<br>
between 1965 and 1968 over three billion dollars were spent in U.S. schools to offset the<br>
disadvantages of about six million children. The program is known as Title One. It is the<br>
most expensive compensatory program ever attempted anywhere in education, yet no<br>
significant improvement can be detected in the learning of these "disadvantaged"<br>
children. Compared with their classmates from middle income homes, they have fallen<br>
further behind. Moreover, in the course of this program, professionals discovered an<br>
additional ten million children laboring under economic and educational handicaps. More<br>
reasons for claiming more federal funds are now at hand.<br>This total failure to improve the education of the poor despite more costly treatment can<br>
be explained in three ways:<br>
<br>Three billion dollars are insufficient to improve the perform-ance of six<br>
million children by a measurable amount; or
<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 6<br>
<br>
The money was incompetently spent: different curricula, better<br>
administration, further concentration of the funds on the poor child, and<br>
more research are needed and would do the trick; or

<br>
Educational disadvantage cannot be cured by relying on education<br>
within the school.

<br>The first is certainly true so long as the money has been spent through the school budget.<br>
The money indeed went to the schools which contained most of the disadvantaged<br>
children, but it was not spent on the poor children themselves. These children for whom<br>
the money was intended comprised only about half of those who were attending the<br>
schools that added the federal subsidies to their budgets. Thus the money was spent for<br>
custodial care, indoctrination and the selection of social roles, as well as education, all of<br>
which functions are inextricably mingled in the physical plants, curricula, teachers,<br>
administrators, and other key components of these schools, and, therefore, in their<br>
budgets.<br>The added funds enabled schools to cater disproportionately to the satisfaction of the<br>
relatively richer children who were "disadvantaged" by having to attend school in the<br>
company of the poor. At best a small fraction of each dollar intended to remedy a poor<br>
child's disadvantages in learning could reach the child through the school budget.<br>It might be equally true that the money was incompetently spent. But even unusual<br>
incompetence cannot beat that of the school system. Schools by their very structure resist<br>
the concentration of privilege on those otherwise disadvantaged. Special curricula,<br>
separate classes, or longer hours only constitute more discrimination at a higher cost.<br>Taxpayers are not yet accustomed to permitting three billion dollars to vanish from HEW<br>
as if it were the Pentagon. The present Administration may believe that it can afford the<br>
wrath of educators. Middle-class Americans have nothing to lose if the program is cut.<br>
Poor parents think they do, but, even more, they are demanding control of the funds<br>
meant for their children. A logical way of cutting the budget and, one hopes, of<br>
increasing benefits is a system of tuition grants such as that proposed by Milton Friedman<br>
and others. Funds would be channeled to the beneficiary, enabling him to buy his share of<br>
the schooling of his choice. If such credit were limited to purchases which fit into a<br>
school curriculum, it would tend to provide greater equality of treatment, but would not<br>
thereby increase the equality of social claims.<br>It should be obvious that even with schools of equal quality a poor child can seldom catch<br>
up with a rich one. Even if they attend equal schools and begin at the same age, poor<br>
children lack most of the educational opportunities which are casually available to the<br>
middle-class child. These advantages range from conversation and books in the home to<br>
vacation travel and a different sense of oneself, and apply, for the child who enjoys them,<br>
both in and out of school. So the poorer student will generally fall behind so long as he<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 7<br>depends on school for advancement or learning. The poor need funds to enable them to<br>
learn, not to get certified for the treatment of their alleged disproportionate deficiencies.<br>All this is true in poor nations as well as in rich ones, but there it appears under a<br>
different guise. Modernized poverty in poor nations affects more people more visibly but<br>
also-for the moment-more superficially. Two-thirds of all children in Latin America leave<br>
school before finishing the fifth grade, but these "desertores" are not therefore as badly<br>
off as they would be in the United States.<br>Few countries today remain victims of classical poverty, which was stable and less<br>
disabling. Most countries in Latin America have reached the "take-off" point toward<br>
economic development and competitive consumption, and thereby toward modernized<br>
poverty: their citizens have learned to think rich and live poor. Their laws make six to ten<br>
years of school obligatory. Not only in Argentina but also in Mexico or Brazil the<br>
average citizen defines an adequate education by North American standards, even though<br>
the chance of getting such prolonged schooling is limited to a tiny minority. In these<br>
countries the majority is already hooked on school, that is, they are schooled in a sense of<br>
inferiority toward the better- schooled. Their fanaticism in favor of school makes it<br>
possible to exploit them doubly: it permits increasing allocation of public funds for the<br>
education of a few and increasing acceptance of social control by the many.<br>Paradoxically, the belief that universal schooling is absolutely necessary is most firmly<br>
held in those countries where the fewest people have been-and will be-served by schools.<br>
Yet in Latin America different paths toward education could still be taken by the majority<br>
of parents and children. Proportionately, national savings invested in schools and teachers<br>
might be higher than in rich countries, but these investments are totally insufficient to<br>
serve the majority by making even four years of school attendance possible. Fidel Castro<br>
talks as if he wanted to go in the direction of deschooling when he promises that by 1980<br>
Cuba will be able to dissolve its university since all of life in Cuba will be an educational<br>
experience. At the grammar-school and high-school level, however, Cuba, like all other<br>
Latin- American countries, acts as though passage through a period defined as the "school<br>
age" were an unquestionable goal for all, delayed merely by a temporary shortage of<br>
resources.<br>The twin deceptions of increased treatment, as actually provided in the United States and<br>
as merely promised in Latin America complement each other. The Northern poor are<br>
being disabled by the same twelve-year treatment whose lack brands the Southern poor as<br>
hopelessly backward. Neither in North America nor in Latin America do the poor get<br>
equality from obligatory schools. But in both places the mere existence of school<br>
discourages and disables the poor from taking control of their own learning. All over the<br>
world the school has an anti-educational effect on society: school is recognized as the<br>
institution which specializes in education. The failures of school are taken by most people<br>
as a proof that education is a very costly, very complex, always arcane, and frequently<br>
almost impossible task.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 8<br>School appropriates the money, men, and good will available for education and in<br>
addition discourages other institutions from assuming educational tasks. Work, leisure,<br>
politics, city living, and even family life depend on schools for the habits and knowledge<br>
they presuppose, instead of becoming themselves the means of education. Simultaneously<br>
both schools and the other institutions which depend on them are priced out of the<br>
market.<br>In the United States the per capita costs of schooling have risen almost as fast as the cost<br>
of medical treatment. But increased treatment by both doctors and teachers has shown<br>
steadily declining results. Medical expenses concentrated on those above forty-five have<br>
doubled several times over a period of forty years with a resulting 3 percent increase in<br>
life expectancy in men. The increase in educational expenditures has produced even<br>
stranger results; otherwise President Nixon could not have been moved this spring to<br>
promise that every child shall soon have the "Right to Read" before leaving school.<br>In the United States it would take eighty billion dollars per year to provide what<br>
educators regard as equal treatment for all in grammar and high school. This is well over<br>
twice the $36 billion now being spent. Independent cost projections prepared at HEW and<br>
the University of Florida indicate that by 1974 the comparable figures will be $107<br>
billion as against the $45 billion now projected, and these figures wholly omit the<br>
enormous costs of what is called "higher education," for which demand is growing even<br>
faster. The United States, which spent nearly eighty billion dollars in 1969 for "defense"<br>
including its deployment in Vietnam, is obviously too poor to provide equal schooling.<br>
The President's committee for the study of school finance should ask not how to support<br>
or how to trim such increasing costs, but how they can be avoided.<br>Equal obligatory schooling must be recognized as at least economically unfeasible. In<br>
Latin America the amount of public money spent on each graduate student is between<br>
350 and 1,500 times the amount spent on the median citizen (that is, the citizen who<br>
holds the middle ground between the poorest and the richest). In the United States the<br>
discrepancy is smaller, but the discrimination is keener. The richest parents, some 10<br>
percent, can afford private education for their children and help them to benefit from<br>
foundation grants. But in addition they obtain ten times the per capita amount of public<br>
funds if this is compared with the per capita expenditure made on the children of the 10<br>
percent who are poorest. The principal reasons for this are that rich children stay longer<br>
in school, that a year in a university is disproportionately more expensive than a year in<br>
high school, and that most private universities depend-at least indirectly-on tax-derived<br>
finances.<br>Obligatory schooling inevitably polarizes a society; it also grades the nations of the world<br>
according to an international caste system. Countries are rated like castes whose<br>
educational dignity is determined by the average years of schooling of its citizens, a<br>
rating which is closely related to per capita gross national product, and much more<br>
painful.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 9<br>The paradox of the schools is evident: increased expenditure escalates their<br>
destructiveness at home and abroad. This paradox must be made a public issue. It is now<br>
generally accepted that the physical environment will soon be destroyed by biochemical<br>
pollution unless we reverse current trends in the production of physical goods. It should<br>
also be recognized that social and personal life is threatened equally by HEW pollution,<br>
the inevitable by-product of obligatory and competitive consumption of welfare.<br>The escalation of the schools is as destructive as the escalation of weapons but less<br>
visibly so. Everywhere in the world school costs have risen faster than enrollments and<br>
faster than the GNP; everywhere expenditures on school fall even further behind the<br>
expectations of parents, teachers, and pupils. Everywhere this situation discourages both<br>
the motivation and the financing for large-scale planning for nonschooled learning. The<br>
United States is proving to the world that no country can be rich enough to afford a<br>
school system that meets the demands this same system creates simply by existing,<br>
because a successful school system schools parents and pupils to the supreme value of a<br>
larger school system, the cost of which increases disproportionately as higher grades are<br>
in demand and become scarce.<br>Rather than calling equal schooling temporarily unfeasible, we must recognize that it is,<br>
in principle, economically absurd, and that to attempt it is intellectually emasculating,<br>
socially polarizing, and destructive of the credibility of the political system which<br>
promotes it. The ideology of obligatory schooling admits of no logical limits. The White<br>
House recently provided a good example. Dr. Hutschnecker, the "psychiatrist" who<br>
treated Mr. Nixon before he was qualified as a candidate, recommended to the President<br>
that all children between six and eight be professionally examined to ferret out those who<br>
have destructive tendencies, and that obligatory treatment be provided for them. If<br>
necessary, their re-education in special institutions should be required. This memorandum<br>
from his doctor the President sent for evaluation to HEW. Indeed, preventive<br>
concentration camps for predelinquents would be a logical improvement over the school<br>
system.<br>Equal educational opportunity is, indeed, both a desirable and a feasible goal, but to<br>
equate this with obligator;' schooling is to confuse salvation with the Church. School has<br>
become the world religion of a modernized proletariat, and makes futile promises of<br>
salvation to the poor of the technological age. The nation-state has adopted it, drafting all<br>
citizens into a graded curriculum leading to sequential diplomas not unlike the initiation<br>
rituals and hieratic promotions of former times. The modern state has assumed the duty<br>
of enforcing the judgment of its educators through well-meant truant officers and job<br>
requirements, much as did the Spanish kings who enforced the judgments of their<br>
theologians through the conquistadors and the Inquisition.<br>Two centuries ago the United States led the world in a movement to disestablish the<br>
monopoly of a single church. Now we need the constitutional disestablishment of the<br>
monopoly of the school, and thereby of a system which legally combines prejudice with<br>
discrimination. The first article of a bill of rights for a modern, humanist society would<br>
correspond to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: "The State shall make no<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 10<br>law with respect to the establishment of education." There shall be no ritual obligatory for<br>
all.<br>To make this disestablishment effective, we need a law forbidding discrimination in<br>
hiring, voting, or admission to centers of learning based on previous attendance at some<br>
curriculum. This guarantee would not exclude performance tests of competence for a<br>
function or role, but would remove the present absurd discrimination in favor of the<br>
person who leams a given skill with the largest expenditure of public funds or what is<br>
equally likely has been able to obtain a diploma which has no relation to any useful skill<br>
or job. Only by protecting the citizen from being disqualified by anything in his career in<br>
school can a constitutional disestablishment of school become psychologically effective.<br>Neither learning nor justice is promoted by schooling because educators insist on<br>
packaging instruction with certification. Learning and the assignment of social roles are<br>
melted into schooling. Yet to learn means to acquire a new skill or insight, while<br>
promotion depends on an opinion which others have formed. Learning frequently is the<br>
result of instruction, but selection for a role or category in the job market increasingly<br>
depends on mere length of attendance.<br>Instruction is the choice of circumstances which facilitate learning. Roles are assigned by<br>
setting a curriculum of conditions which the candidate must meet if he is to make the<br>
grade. School links instruction but not learning to these roles. This is neither reasonable<br>
nor liberating. It is not reasonable because it does not link relevant qualities or<br>
competences to roles, but rather the process by which such qualities are supposed to be<br>
acquired. It is not liberating or educational because school reserves instruction to those<br>
whose every step in learning fits previously approved measures of social control.<br>Curriculum has always been used to assign social rank. At times it could be prenatal:<br>
karma ascribes you to a caste and lineage to the aristocracy. Curriculum could take the<br>
form of a ritual, of sequential sacred ordinations, or it could consist of a succession of<br>
feats in war or hunting, or further advancement could be made to depend on a series of<br>
previous princely favors. Universal schooling was meant to detach role assignment from<br>
personal life history: it was meant to give everybody an equal chance to any office. Even<br>
now many people wrongly believe that school ensures the dependence of public trust on<br>
relevant learning achievements. However, instead of equalizing chances, the school<br>
system has monopolized their distribution.<br>To detach competence from curriculum, inquiries into a man's learning history must be<br>
made taboo, like inquiries into his political affiliation, church attendance, lineage, sex<br>
habits, or racial background. Laws forbidding discrimination on the basis of prior<br>
schooling must be enacted. Laws, of course, cannot stop prejudice against the<br>
unschooled-nor are they meant to force anyone to intermarry with an autodidact but they<br>
can discourage unjustified discrimination.<br>A second major illusion on which the school system rests is that most learning is the<br>
result of teaching. Teaching, it is true, may contribute to certain kinds of learning under<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 11<br>certain circumstances. But most people acquire most of their knowledge outside school,<br>
and in school only insofar as school, in a few rich countries, has become their place of<br>
confinement during an increasing part of their lives.<br>Most learning happens casually, and even most intentional learning is not the result of<br>
programmed instruction. Normal children learn their first language casually, although<br>
faster if their parents pay attention to them. Most people who learn a second language<br>
well do so as a result of odd circumstances and not of sequential teaching. They go to live<br>
with their grandparents, they travel, or they fall in love with a foreigner. Fluency in<br>
reading is also more often than not a result of such extracurricular activities. Most people<br>
who read widely, and with pleasure, merely believe that they learned to do so in school;<br>
when challenged, they easily discard this illusion.<br>But the fact that a great deal of learning even now seems to happen casually and as a by-<br>
product of some other activity defined as work or leisure does not mean that planned<br>
learning does not benefit from planned instruction and that both do not stand in need of<br>
improvement. The strongly motivated student who is faced with the task of acquiring a<br>
new and complex skill may benefit greatly from the discipline now associated with the<br>
old-fashioned schoolmaster who taught reading, Hebrew, catechism, or multiplication by<br>
rote. School has now made this kind of drill teaching rare and disreputable, yet there are<br>
many skills which a motivated student with normal aptitude can master in a matter of a<br>
few months if taught in this traditional way. This is as true of codes as of their<br>
encipherment; of second and third languages as of reading and writing; and equally of<br>
special languages such as algebra, computer programming, chemical analysis, or of<br>
manual skills like typing, watchmaking, plumbing, wiring, TV repair; or for that matter<br>
dancing, driving, and diving.<br>In certain cases acceptance into a learning program aimed at a specific skill might<br>
presuppose competence in some other skill, but it should certainly not be made to depend<br>
upon the process by which such prerequisite skills were acquired. TV repair presupposes<br>
literacy and some math; diving, good swimming; and driving, very little of either.<br>Progress in learning skills is measurable. The optimum resources in time and materials<br>
needed by an average motivated adult can be easily estimated. The cost of teaching a<br>
second Western European language to a high level of fluency ranges between four and<br>
six hundred dollars in the United States, and for an Oriental tongue the time needed for<br>
instruction might be doubled. This would still be very little compared with the cost of<br>
twelve years of schooling in New York City (a condition for acceptance of a worker into<br>
the Sanitation Department) almost fifteen thousand dollars. No doubt not only the teacher<br>
but also the printer and the pharmacist protect their trades through the public illusion that<br>
training for them is very expensive.<br>At present schools pre-empt most educational funds. Drill instruction which costs less<br>
than comparable schooling is now a privilege of those rich enough to bypass the schools,<br>
and those whom either the army or big business sends through in-service training. In a<br>
program of progressive deschooling of U.S. education, at first the resources available for<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 12<br>drill training would be limited. But ultimately there should be no obstacle for anyone at<br>
any time of his life to be able to choose instruction among hundreds of definable skills at<br>
public expense.<br>Right now educational credit good at any skill center could be provided in limited<br>
amounts for people of all ages, and not just to the poor. I envisage such credit in the form<br>
of an educational passport or an "edu-credit card" provided to each citizen at birth. In<br>
order to favor the poor, who probably would not use their yearly grants early in life, a<br>
provision could be made that interest accrued to later users of cumulated "entitlements."<br>
Such credits would permit most people to acquire the skills most in demand, at their<br>
convenience, better, faster, cheaper, and with fewer undesirable side effects than in<br>
school.<br>Potential skill teachers are never scarce for long because, on the one hand, demand for a<br>
skill grows only with its performance within a community and, on the other, a man<br>
exercising a skill could also teach it. But, at present, those using skills which are in<br>
demand and do require a human teacher are discouraged from sharing these skills with<br>
others. This is done either by teachers who monopolize the licenses or by unions which<br>
protect their trade interests. Skill centers which would be judged by customers on their<br>
results, and not on the personnel they employ or the process they use, would open<br>
unsuspected working opportunities, frequently even for those who are now considered<br>
unemployable. Indeed, there is no reason why such skill centers should not be at the work<br>
place itself, with the employer and his work force supplying instruction as well as jobs to<br>
those who choose to use their educational credits in this way.<br>In 1956 there arose a need to teach Spanish quickly to several hundred teachers, social<br>
workers, and ministers from the New York Archdiocese so that they could communicate<br>
with Puerto Ricans. My friend Gerry Morris announced over a Spanish radio station that<br>
he needed native speakers from Harlem. Next day some two hundred teen-agers lined up<br>
in front of his office, and he selected four dozen of them-many of them school dropouts.<br>
He trained them in the use of the U.S. Foreign Service Institute (FSI) Spanish manual,<br>
designed for use by linguists with graduate training, and within a week his teachers were<br>
on their own-each in charge of four New Yorkers who wanted to speak the language.<br>
Within six months the mission was accomplished. Cardinal Spellman could claim that he<br>
had 127 parishes in which at least three staff members could communicate in Spanish. No<br>
school program could have matched these results.<br>Skill teachers are made scarce by the belief in the value of licenses. Certification<br>
constitutes a form of market manipulation and is plausible only to a schooled mind. Most<br>
teachers of arts and trades are less skillful, less inventive, and less communicative than<br>
the best craftsmen and tradesmen. Most high-school teachers of Spanish or French do not<br>
speak the language as correctly as their pupils might after half a year of competent drills.<br>
Experiments conducted by Angel Quintero in Puerto Rico suggest that many young teen-<br>
agers, if given the proper incentives, programs, and access to tools, are better than most<br>
schoolteachers at introducing their peers to the scientific exploration of plants, stars, and<br>
matter, and to the discovery of how and why a motor or a radio functions.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 13<br>Opportunities for skill-learning can be vastly multiplied if we open the "market." This<br>
depends on matching the right teacher with the right student when he is highly motivated<br>
in an intelligent program, without the constraint of curriculum.<br>Free and competing drill instruction is a subversive blasphemy to the orthodox educator.<br>It dissociates the acquisition of skills from "humane" education, which schools package<br>
together, and thus it promotes unlicensed learning no less than unlicensed teaching for<br>
unpredictable purposes.<br>There is currently a proposal on record which seems at first to make a great deal of sense.<br>
It has been prepared by Christopher Jencks of the Center for the Study of Public Policy<br>
and is sponsored by the Office of Economic Opportunity. It proposes to put educational<br>
"entitlements" or tuition grants into the hands of parents and students for expenditure in<br>
the schools of their choice. Such individual entitlements could indeed be an important<br>
step in the right direction. We need a guarantee of the right of each citizen to an equal<br>
share of tax-derived educational resources, the right to verify this share, and the right to<br>
sue for it if denied. It is one form of a guarantee against regressive taxation.<br>The Jencks proposal, however, begins with the ominous statement that "conservatives,<br>
liberals, and radicals have all complained at one time or another that the American<br>
educational system gives professional educators too little incentive to provide high<br>
quality education to most children." The proposal condemns itself by proposing tuition<br>
grants which would have to be spent on schooling.<br>This is like giving a lame man a pair of crutches and stipulating that he use them only if<br>
the ends are tied together. As the proposal for tuition grants now stands, it plays into the<br>
hands not only of the professional educators but of racists, promoters of religious schools,<br>
and others whose interests are socially divisive. Above all, educational entitlements<br>
restricted to use within schools play into the hands of all those who want to continue to<br>
live in a society in which social advancement is tied not to proven knowledge but to the<br>
learning pedigree by which it is supposedly acquired. This discrimination in favor of<br>
schools which dominates Jencks's discussion on refinancing education could discredit<br>
one of the most critically needed principles for educational reform: the return of initiative<br>
and accountability for learning to the learner or his most immediate tutor.<br>The deschooling of society implies a recognition of the two-faced nature of learning. An<br>
insistence on skill drill alone could be a disaster; equal emphasis must be placed on other<br>
kinds of learning. But if schools are the wrong places for learning a skill, they are even<br>
worse places for getting an education. School does both tasks badly, partly because it<br>
does not distinguish between them. School is inefficient in skill instruction especially<br>
because it is curricular. In most schools a program which is meant to improve one skill is<br>
chained always to another irrelevant task. History is tied to advancement in math, and<br>
class attendance to the right to use the playground.<br>Schools are even less efficient in the arrangement of the circumstances which encourage<br>
the open-ended, exploratory use of acquired skills, for which I will reserve the term<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 14<br>"liberal education." The main reason for this is that school is obligatory and becomes<br>
schooling for schooling's sake: an enforced stay in the company of teachers, which pays<br>
off in the doubtful privilege of more such company. Just as skill instruction must be freed<br>
from curricular restraints, so must liberal education be dissociated from obligatory<br>
attendance. Both skill-learning and education for inventive and creative behavior can be<br>
aided by institutional arrangement, but they are of a different, frequently opposed nature.<br>Most skills can be acquired and improved by drills, because skill implies the mastery of<br>
definable and predictable behavior. Skill instruction can rely, therefore, on the simulation<br>
of circumstances in which the skill will be used. Education in the exploratory and<br>
creative use of skills, however, cannot rely on drills. Education can be the outcome of<br>
instruction, though instruction of a kind fundamentally opposed to drill. It relies on the<br>
relationship between partners who already have some of the keys which give access to<br>
memories stored in and by the community. It relies on the critical intent of all those who<br>
use memories creatively. It relies on the surprise of the unexpected question which opens<br>
new doors for the inquirer and his partner.<br>The skill instructor relies on the arrangement of set circumstances which permit the<br>
learner to develop standard responses. The educational guide or master is concerned with<br>
helping matching partners to meet so that learning can take place. He matches individuals<br>
starting from their own, unresolved questions. At the most he helps the pupil to formulate<br>
his puzzlement since only a clear statement will give him the power to find his match,<br>
moved like him, at the moment, to explore the same issue in the same context.<br>Matching partners for educational purposes initially seems more difficult to imagine than<br>
finding skill instructors and partners for a game. One reason is the deep fear which school<br>
has implanted in us, a fear which makes us censorious. The unlicensed exchange of<br>
skills-even undesirable skills-is more predictable and therefore seems less dangerous than<br>
the unlimited opportunity for meeting among people who share an issue which for them,<br>
at the moment, is socially, intellectually, and emotionally important.<br>The Brazilian teacher Paulo Freire knows this from experience. He discovered that any<br>
adult can begin to read in a matter of forty hours if the first words he deciphers are<br>
charged with political meaning. Freire trains his teachers to move into a village and to<br>
discover the words which designate current important issues, such as the access to a well<br>
or the compound interest on the debts owed to the patron. In the evening the villagers<br>
meet for the discussion of these key words. They begin to realize that each word stays on<br>
the blackboard even after its sound has faded. The letters continue to unlock reality and to<br>
make it manageable as a problem. I have frequently witnessed how discussants grow in<br>
social awareness and how they are impelled to take political action as fast as they learn to<br>
read. They seem to take reality into their hands as they write it down.<br>I remember the man who complained about the weight of pencils: they were difficult to<br>
handle because they did not weigh as much as a shovel; and I remember another who on<br>
his way to work stopped with his Companions and wrote the word they were discussing<br>
with his hoe on the ground: "agua. " Since 1962 my friend Freire has moved from exile to<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 15<br>exile, mainly because he refuses to conduct his sessions around words which are<br>
preselected by approved educators, rather than those which his discussants bring to the<br>
class.<br>The educational matchmaking among people who have been successfully schooled is a<br>
different task. Those who do not need such assistance are a minority, even among the<br>
readers of serious journals. The majority cannot and should not be rallied for discussion<br>
around a slogan, a word, or a picture. But the idea remains the same: they should be able<br>
to meet around a problem chosen and defined by their own initiative. Creative,<br>
exploratory learning requires peers currently puzzled about the same terms or problems.<br>
Large universities make the futile attempt to match them by multiplying their courses,<br>
and they generally fail since they are bound to curriculum, course structure, and<br>
bureaucratic administration. In schools, including universities, most resources are spent<br>
to purchase the time and motivation of a limited number of people to take up<br>
predetermined problems in a ritually defined setting. The most radical alternative to<br>
school would be a network or service which gave each man the same opportunity to share<br>
his current concern with others motivated by the same concern.<br>Let me give, as an example of what I mean, a description of how an intellectual match<br>
might work in New York City. Each man, at any given moment and at a minimum price,<br>
could identify himself to a computer with his address and telephone number, indicating<br>
the book, article, film, or recording on which he seeks a partner for discussion. Within<br>
days he could receive by mail the list of others who recently had taken the same<br>
initiative. This list would enable him by telephone to arrange for a meeting with persons<br>
who initially would be known exclusively by the fact that they requested a dialogue about<br>
the same subject.<br>Matching people according to their interest in a particular title is radically simple. It<br>
permits identification only on the basis of a mutual desire to discuss a statement recorded<br>
by a third person, and it leaves the initiative of arranging the meeting to the individual.<br>
Three objections are usually raised against this skeletal purity. I take them up not only to<br>
clarify the theory that I want to illustrate by my proposal for they highlight the deep-<br>
seated resistance to deschooling education, to separating learning from social control but<br>
also because they may help to suggest existing resources which are not now used for<br>
learning purposes.<br>The first objection is: Why cannot self-identification be based also on an idea or an<br>
issue? Certainly such subjective terms could also be used in a computer system. Political<br>
parties, churches, unions, clubs, neighborhood centers, and professional societies already<br>
organize their educational activities in this way and in effect they act as schools. They all<br>
match people in order to explore certain "themes"; and these are dealt with in courses,<br>
seminars, and curricula in which presumed "common interests" are prepackaged. Such<br>
theme-matching is by definition teacher-centered: it requires an authoritarian presence to<br>
define for the participants the starting point for their discussion.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 16<br>By contrast, matching by the title of a book, film, etc., in its pure form leaves it to the<br>
author to define the special language, the terms, and the framework within which a given<br>
problem or fact is stated; and it enables those who accept this starting point to identify<br>
themselves to one another. For instance, matching people around the idea of "cultural<br>
revolution" usually leads either to confusion or to demagoguery. On the other hand,<br>
matching those interested in helping each other understand a specific article by Mao,<br>
Marcuse, Freud, or Goodman stands in the great tradition of liberal learning from Plato's<br>
Dialogues, which are built around presumed statements by Socrates, to Aquinas's<br>
commentaries on Peter the Lombard. The idea of matching by title is thus radically<br>
different from the theory on which the "Great Books" clubs, for example, were built:<br>
instead of relying on the selection by some Chicago professors, any two partners can<br>
choose any book for further analysis.<br>The second objection asks: Why not let the identification of match seekers include<br>
information on age, background, world view, competence, experience, or other defining<br>
characteristics? Again, there is no reason why such discriminatory restrictions could not<br>
and should not be built into some of the many universities-with or without walls-which<br>
could use title-matching as their basic organizational device. I could conceive of a system<br>
designed to encourage meetings of interested persons at which the author of the book<br>
chosen would be present or represented; or a system which guaranteed the presence of a<br>
competent adviser; or one to which only students registered in a department or school had<br>
access; or one which permitted meetings only between people who defined their special<br>
approach to the title under discussion. Advantages for achieving specific goals of<br>
learning could be found for each of these restrictions. But I fear that, more often than not,<br>
the real reason for proposing such restrictions is contempt arising from the presumption<br>
that people are ignorant: educators want to avoid the ignorant meeting the ignorant<br>
around a text which they may not understand and which they read only because they are<br>
interested in it.<br>The third objection: Why not provide match seekers with incidental assistance that will<br>
facilitate their meetings-with space, schedules, screening, and protection? This is now<br>
done by schools with all the inefficiency characterizing large bureaucracies. If we left the<br>
initiative for meetings to the match seekers themselves, organizations which nobody now<br>
classifies as educational would probably do the job much better. I think of restaurant<br>
owners, publishers, telephone-answering services, department store managers, and even<br>
commuter train executives who could promote their services by rendering them attractive<br>
for educational meetings.<br>At a first meeting in a coffee shop, say, the partners might establish their identities by<br>
placing the book under discussion next to their cups. People who took the initiative to<br>
arrange for such meetings would soon learn what items to quote to meet the people they<br>
sought. The risk that the self-chosen discussion with one or several strangers might lead<br>
to a loss of time, disappointment, or even unpleasantness is certainly smaller than the<br>
same risk taken by a college applicant. A computer arranged meeting to discuss an article<br>
in a national magazine, held in a coffee shop off Fourth Avenue, would obligate none of<br>
the participants to stay in the company of his new acquaintances for longer than it took to<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 17<br>drink a cup of coffee, nor would he have to meet any of them ever again. The chance that<br>
it would help to pierce the opaqueness of life in a modem city and further new friendship,<br>
self-chosen work, and critical reading is high. (The fact that a record of personal readings<br>
and meetings could be obtained thus by the FBI is undeniable; that this should still worry<br>
anybody in 1970 is only amusing to a free man, who willy-nilly contributes his share in<br>
order to drown snoopers in the irrelevancies they gather.)<br>Both the exchange of skills and matching of partners are based on the assumption that<br>
education for all means education by all. Not the draft into a specialized institution but<br>
only the mobilization of the whole population can lead to popular culture. The equal right<br>
of each man to exercise his competence to learn and to instruct is now pre-empted by<br>
certified teachers. The teachers' competence, in turn, is restricted to what may be done in<br>
school. And, further, work and leisure are alienated from each other as a result: the<br>
spectator and the worker alike are supposed to arrive at the work place all ready to fit into<br>
a routine prepared for them. Adaptation in the form of a product's design, instruction, and<br>
publicity shapes them for their role as much as formal education by schooling. A radical<br>
alternative to a schooled society requires not only new formal mechanisms for the formal<br>
acquisition of skills and their educational use. A deschooled society implies a new<br>
approach to incidental or informal education.<br>Incidental education cannot any longer return to the forms which learning took in the<br>
village or the medieval town. Traditional society was more like a set of concentric circles<br>
of meaningful structures, while modem man must learn how to find meaning in many<br>
structures to which he is only marginally related. In the village, language and architecture<br>
and work and religion and family customs were consistent with one another, mutually<br>
explanatory and reinforcing. To grow into one implied a growth into the others. Even<br>
specialized apprenticeship was a by-product of specialized activities, such as shoemaking<br>
or the singing of psalms. If an apprentice never became a master or a scholar, he still<br>
contributed to making shoes or to making church services solemn. Education did not<br>
compete for time with either work or leisure. Almost all education was complex, lifelong,<br>
and unplanned.<br>Contemporary society is the result of conscious designs, and educational opportunities<br>
must be designed into them. Our reliance on specialized, full-time instruction through<br>
school will now decrease, and we must find more ways to learn and teach: the<br>
educational quality of all institutions must increase again. But this is a very ambiguous<br>
forecast. It could mean that men in the modem city will be increasingly the victims of an<br>
effective process of total instruction and manipulation once they are deprived of even the<br>
tenuous pretense of critical independence which liberal schools now provide for at least<br>
some of their pupils.<br>It could also mean that men will shield themselves less behind certificates acquired in<br>
school and thus gain in courage to "talk back" and thereby control and instruct the<br>
institutions in which they participate. To ensure the latter we must learn to estimate the<br>
social value of work and leisure by the educational give-and. take for which they offer<br>
opportunity. Effective participation in the politics of a street, a work place, the library, a<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 18<br>news program, or a hospital is therefore the best measuring stick to evaluate their level as<br>
educational institutions.<br>I recently spoke to a group of junior-high-school students in the process of organizing a<br>
resistance movement to their obligatory draft into the next class. Their slogan was<br>
"participation not simulation." They were disappointed that this was understood as a<br>
demand for less rather than for more education, and reminded me of the resistance which<br>
Karl Marx put up against a passage in the Gotha program which-one hundred years ago<br>
wanted to outlaw child labor. He opposed the proposal in the interest of the education of<br>
the young, which could happen only at work. If the greatest fruit of man's labor should be<br>
the education he receives from it and the opportunity which work gives him to initiate the<br>
education of others, then the alienation of modern society in a pedagogical sense is even<br>
worse than its economic alienation.<br>The major obstacle on the way to a society that truly educates was well defined by a<br>
black friend of mine in Chicago, who told me that our imagination was "all schooled up."<br>
We permit the state to ascertain the universal educational deficiencies of its citizens and<br>
establish one specialized agency to treat them. We thus share in the dyl5<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 19<br>2<br>Phenomenology of School<br>Some words become so flexible that they cease to be useful "School" and "teaching" are<br>
such terms. Like an amoeba they fit into almost any interstice of the language. ABM will<br>
teach the Russians, IBM will teach Negro children, and the army can become the school<br>
of a nation.<br>The search for alternatives in education must therefore start with an agreement on what it<br>
is we mean by "school." This might be done in several ways. We could begin by listing<br>
the latent functions performed by modern school systems, such as custodial care,<br>
selection, indoctrination, and learning. We could make a client analysis and verify which<br>
of these latent functions render a service or a disservice to teachers, employers, children,<br>
parents, or the professions. We could survey the history of Western culture and the<br>
information gathered by anthropology in order to find institutions which played a role<br>
like that now performed by schooling. We could, finally, recall the many normative<br>
statements which have been made since the time of Comenius, or even since Quintilian,<br>
and discover which of these the modern school system most closely approaches. But any<br>
of these approaches would oblige us to start with certain assumptions about a relationship<br>
between school and education. To develop a language in which we can speak about<br>
school without such constant recourse to education, I have chosen to begin with<br>
something that might be called a phenomenology of public school. For this purpose I<br>
shall define "school" as the age-specific, teacher-related process requiring full-time<br>
attendance at an obligatory curriculum.<br>
<br>Age School groups people according to age. This grouping rests on three unquestioned<br>
premises. Children belong in school.
<br>Children learn in school. Children can be taught only in school. I think these unexamined<br>
premises deserve serious questioning. We have grown accustomed to children. We have<br>
decided that they should go to school, do as they are told, and have neither income nor<br>
families of their own. We expect them to know their place and behave like children. We<br>
remember, whether nostalgically or bitterly, a time when we were children, too. We are<br>
expected to tolerate the childish behavior of children. Man-kind, for us, is a species both<br>
afflicted and blessed with the task of caring for children. We forget, however, that our<br>
present concept of "childhood" developed only recently in Western Europe and more<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 20<br>recently still in the Americas. [ For parallel histories of modern capitalism and modern<br>
childhood see Philippe Aries, Centuries Of Childhood, Knopf, 1962.]<br>Childhood as distinct from infancy, adolescence, or youth was unknown to most<br>
historical periods. Some Christian centuries did not even have an eye for its bodily<br>
proportions. Artists depicted the infant as a miniature adult seated on his mother's arm.<br>
Children appeared in Europe along with the pocket watch and the Christian moneylenders<br>
of the Renaissance. Before our century neither the poor nor the rich knew of children's<br>
dress, children's games, or the child's immunity from the law. Childhood belonged to the<br>
bourgeoisie. The worker's child, the peasant's child, and the nobleman's child all dressed<br>
the way their fathers dressed, played the way their fathers played, and were hanged by the<br>
neck as were their fathers. After the discovery of "childhood" by the bourgeoisie all this<br>
changed. Only some churches continued to respect for some time the dignity and maturity<br>
of the young. Until the Second Vatican Council, each child was instructed that a Christian<br>
reaches moral discernment and freedom at the age of seven, and from then on is capable<br>
of committing sins for which he may be punished by an eternity in Hell. Toward the<br>
middle of this century, middle-class parents began to try to spare their children the impact<br>
of this doctrine, and their thinking about children now prevails in the practice of the<br>
Church.<br>Until the last century, "children" of middle-class parents were made at home with the<br>
help of preceptors and private schools. Only with the advent of industrial society did the<br>
mass production of "childhood" become feasible and come within the reach of the<br>
masses. The school system is a modern phenomenon, as is the childhood it produces.<br>Since most people today live outside industrial cities, most people today do not<br>
experience childhood. In the Andes you till the soil once you have become "useful."<br>
Before that, you watch the sheep. If you are well nourished, you should be useful by<br>
eleven, and otherwise by twelve. Recently, I was talking to my night watchman, Marcos,<br>
about his eleven-year-old son who works in a barbershop. I noted in Spanish that his son<br>
was still a "ni-o, ” Marcos, surprised, answered with a guileless smile: "Don Ivan, I guess<br>
you're right." Realizing that until my remark the father had thought of Marcos primarily<br>
as his "son," I felt guilty for having drawn the curtain of childhood between two sensible<br>
persons. Of course if I were to tell the New York slum-dweller that his working son is<br>
still a "child," he would show no surprise. He knows quite well that his eleven-year-old<br>
son should be allowed childhood, and resents the fact that he is not. The son of Marcos<br>
has yet to be afflicted with the yearning for childhood; the New Yorker's son feels<br>
deprived.<br>Most people around the world, then, either do not want or cannot get modem childhood<br>
for their offspring. But it also seems that childhood is a burden to a good number of those<br>
few who are allowed it. Many of them are simply forced to go through it and are not at all<br>
happy playing the child's role. Growing up through childhood means being condemned to<br>
a process of in-human conflict between self-awareness and the role imposed by a society<br>
going through its own school age. Neither Stephen Daedalus nor Alexander Portnoy<br>
enjoyed childhood, and neither, I suspect, did many of us like to be treated as children.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 21<br>If there were no age-specific and obligatory learning institution, "childhood" would go<br>
out of production. The youth of rich nations would be liberated from its destructiveness,<br>
and poor nations would cease attempting to rival the childishness of the rich. If society<br>
were to outgrow its age of childhood, it would have to become livable for the young. The<br>
present disjunction between an adult society which pretends to be humane and a school<br>
environment which mocks reality could no longer be maintained.<br>The disestablishment of schools could also end the present discrimination against infants,<br>
adults, and the old in favor of children throughout their adolescence and youth. The social<br>
decision to allocate educational resources preferably to those citizens who have outgrown<br>
the extraordinary learning capacity of their first four years and have not arrived at the<br>
height of their self-motivated learning will, in retrospect, probably appear as bizarre.<br>Institutional wisdom tells us that children need school. Institutional wisdom tells us that<br>
children leam in school. But this institutional wisdom is itself the product of schools<br>
because sound common sense tells us that only children can be taught in school. Only by<br>
segregating human beings in the category of childhood could we ever get them to submit<br>
to the authority of a schoolteacher.<br>
<br>Teachers and Pupils By definition, children are pupils. The demand for the milieu of<br>
childhood creates an unlimited market for accredited teachers. School is an institution<br>
built on the axiom that learning is the result of teaching. And institutional wisdom<br>
continues to accept this axiom, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
<br>We have all learned most of what we know outside school. Pupils do most of their<br>
learning without, and often despite, their teachers. Most tragically, the majority of men<br>
are taught their lesson by schools, even though they never go to school.<br>Everyone learns how to live outside school. We learn to speak, to think, to love, to feel,<br>
to play, to curse, to politick, and to work without interference from a teacher. Even<br>
children who are under a teacher's care day and night are no exception to the rule.<br>
Orphans, idiots, and schoolteachers' sons leam most of what they learn outside the<br>
"educational" process planned for them. Teachers have made a poor showing in their<br>
attempts at increasing learning among the poor. Poor parents who want their children to<br>
go to school are less concerned about what they will learn than about the certificate and<br>
money they will earn. And middle-class parents commit their children to a teacher's care<br>
to keep them from learning what the poor leam on the streets. Increasingly educational<br>
research demonstrates that children leam most of what teachers pretend to teach them<br>
from peer groups, from comics, from chance observations, and above all from mere<br>
participation in the ritual of school. Teachers, more often than not, obstruct such learning<br>
of subject matters as goes on in school.<br>Half of the people in our world never set foot in school. They have no contact with<br>
teachers, and they are deprived of the privilege of becoming dropouts. Yet they leam<br>
quite effectively the message which school teaches: that they should have school, and<br>
more and more of it. School instructs them in their own inferiority through the tax<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 22<br>collector who makes them pay for it, or through the demagogue who raises their<br>
expectations of it, or through their children once the latter are hooked on it. So the poor<br>
are robbed of their self-respect by subscribing to a creed that grants salvation only<br>
through the school. At least the Church gave them a chance to repent at the hour of death.<br>
School leaves them with the expectation (a counterfeit hope) that their grandchildren will<br>
make it. That expectation is of course still more learning which comes from school but<br>
not from teachers.<br>Pupils have never credited teachers for most of their learning. Bright and dull alike have<br>
always relied on rote, reading, and wit to pass their exams, motivated by the stick or by<br>
the carrot of a desired career.<br>Adults tend to romanticize their schooling. In retrospect, they attribute their learning to<br>
the teacher whose patience they learned to admire. But the same adults would worry<br>
about the mental health of a child who rushed home to tell them what he learned from his<br>
every teacher.<br>Schools create jobs for schoolteachers, no matter what their pupils learn from them.<br>
<br>Full-Time Attendance Every month I see another list of proposals made by some U.S.<br>
industry to AID, suggesting the replacement of Latin-American "classroom practitioners"<br>
either by disciplined systems administrators or just by TV. In the United States teaching<br>
as a team enterprise of educational researchers, designers, and technicians is gaining<br>
acceptance. But, no matter whether the teacher is a schoolmarm or a team of men in<br>
white coats, and no matter whether they succeed in teaching the subject matter listed in<br>
the catalogue or whether they fail, the professional teacher creates a sacred milieu.
<br>Uncertainty about the future of professional teaching puts the classroom into jeopardy.<br>
Were educational professionals to specialize in promoting learning, they would have to<br>
abandon a system which calls for between 750 and 1,000 gatherings a year. But of course<br>
teachers do a lot more. The institutional wisdom of schools tells parents, pupils, and<br>
educators that the teacher, if he is to teach, must exercise his authority in a sacred<br>
precinct. This is true even for teachers whose pupils spend most of their school time in a<br>
classroom without walls.<br>School, by its very nature, tends to make a total claim on the time and energies of its<br>
participants. This, in turn, makes the teacher into custodian, preacher, and therapist.<br>In each of these three roles the teacher bases his authority on a different claim.<br>Th eteacher-as-custodian acts as a master of ceremonies, who guides his pupils through a<br>
drawn-out labyrinthine ritual. He arbitrates the observance of rules and administers the<br>
intricate rubrics of initiation to life. At his best, he sets the stage for the acquisition of<br>
some skill as schoolmasters always have. Without illusions of producing any profound<br>
learning, he drills his pupils in some basic routines.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 23<br>The teacher-as-moralist substitutes for parents, God, or the state. He indoctrinates the<br>
pupil about what is right or wrong, not only in school but also in society at large. He<br>
stands in loco parentis for each one and thus ensures that all feel themselves children of<br>
the same state.<br>The teacher-as-therapist feels authorized to delve into the personal life of his pupil in<br>
order to help him grow as a person. When this function is exercised by a custodian and<br>
preacher, it usually means that he persuades the pupil to submit to a domestication of his<br>
vision of truth and his sense of what is right.<br>The claim that a liberal society can be founded on the modern school is paradoxical. The<br>
safeguards of individual freedom are all canceled in the dealings of a teacher with his<br>
pupil. When the schoolteacher fuses in his person the functions of judge, ideologue, and<br>
doctor, the fundamental style of society is perverted by the very process which should<br>
prepare for life. A teacher who combines these three powers contributes to the warping of<br>
the child much more than the laws which establish his legal or economic minority, or<br>
restrict his right to free assembly or abode.<br>Teachers are by no means the only professionals who offer therapy. Psychiatrists,<br>
guidance counselors, and job counselors, even lawyers, help their clients to decide, to<br>
develop their personalities, and to learn. Yet common sense tells the client that such<br>
professionals should abstain from imposing their opinion of what is right or wrong, or<br>
from forcing anyone to follow their advice. Schoolteachers and ministers are the only<br>
professionals who feel entitled to pry into the private affairs of their clients at the same<br>
time as they preach to a captive audience.<br>Children are protected by neither the First nor the Fifth Amendment when they stand<br>
before that secular priest, the teacher. The child must confront a man who wears an<br>
invisible triple crown, like the papal tiara, the symbol of triple authority combined in one<br>
person. For the child, the teacher pontificates as pastor, prophet, and priest-he is at once<br>
guide, teacher, and administrator of a sacred ritual. He combines the claims of medieval<br>
popes in a society constituted under the guarantee that these claims shall never be<br>
exercised together by one established and obligatory institution— church or state.<br>Defining children as full-time pupils permits the teacher to exercise a kind of power over<br>
their persons which is much less limited by constitutional and consuetudinal restrictions<br>
than the power wielded by the guardians of other social enclaves. Their chronological age<br>
disqualifies children from safeguards which are routine for adults in a modern asylum-<br>
madhouse, monastery, or jail.<br>Under the authoritative eye of the teacher, several orders of value collapse into one. The<br>
distinctions between morality, legal, ity, and personal worth are blurred and eventually<br>
eliminated. Each transgression is made to be felt as a multiple offense. The offender is<br>
expected to feel that he has broken a rule, that he has behaved immorally, and that he has<br>
let himself down. A pupil who adroitly obtains assistance on an exam is told that he is an<br>
outlaw, morally corrupt, and personally worthless.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 24<br>Classroom attendance removes children from the everyday world of Western culture and<br>
plunges them into an environment far more primitive, magical, and deadly serious.<br>School could not create such an enclave within which the rules of ordinary reality are<br>
suspended, unless it physically incarcerated the young during many successive years on<br>
sacred territory. The attendance rule makes it possible for the schoolroom to serve as a<br>
magic womb, from which the child is delivered periodically at the school days and school<br>
year's completion until he is finally expelled into adult life. Neither universal extended<br>
childhood nor the smothering atmosphere of the classroom could exist without schools.<br>
Yet schools, as compulsory channels for learning, could exist without either and be more<br>
repressive and destructive than anything we have come to know. To understand what it<br>
means to deschool society, and not just to reform the educational establishment, we must<br>
now focus on the hidden curriculum of schooling. We are not concerned here, directly,<br>
with the hidden curriculum of the ghetto streets which brands the poor or with the hidden<br>
curriculum of the drawing room which benefits the rich. We are rather concerned to call<br>
attention to the fact that the ceremonial or ritual of schooling itself constitutes such a<br>
hidden curriculum. Even the best of teachers cannot entirely protect his pupils from it.<br>
Inevitably, this hidden curriculum of schooling adds prejudice and guilt to the<br>
discrimination which a society practices against some of its members and compounds the<br>
privilege of others with a new title to condescend to the majority. Just as inevitably, this<br>
hidden curriculum serves as a ritual of initiation into a growth-oriented consumer society<br>
for rich and poor alike.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 25<br>3<br>Ritualization of Progress<br>The university graduate has been schooled for selective service among the rich of the<br>
world. Whatever his or her claims of solidarity with the Third World, each American<br>
college graduate has had an education costing an amount five times greater than the<br>
median life income of half of humanity. A Latin American student is introduced to this<br>
exclusive fraternity by having at least 350 times as much public money spent on his<br>
education as on that of his fellow citizens of median income. With very rare exceptions,<br>
the university graduate from a poor country feels more comfortable with his North<br>
American and European colleagues than with his nonschooled compatriots, and all<br>
students are academically processed to be happy only in the company of fellow<br>
consumers of the products of the educational machine.<br>The modern university confers the privilege of dissent on those who have been tested and<br>
classified as potential money-makers or power-holders. No one is given tax funds for the<br>
leisure in which to educate himself or the right to educate others unless at the same time<br>
he can also be certified for achievement. Schools select for each successive level those<br>
who have, at earlier stages in the game, proved themselves good risks for the established<br>
order. Having a monopoly on both the resources for learning and the investiture of social<br>
roles, the university coopts the discoverer and the potential dissenter. A degree always<br>
leaves its indelible price tag on the curriculum of its consumer. Certified college<br>
graduates fit only into a world which puts a price tag on their heads, thereby giving them<br>
the power to define the level of expectations in their society. In each country the amount<br>
of consumption by the college graduate sets the standard for all others; if they would be<br>
civilized people on or off the job, they will aspire to the style of life of college graduates.<br>The university thus has the effect of imposing consumer standards at work and at home,<br>
and it does so in every part of the world and under every political system. The fewer<br>
university graduates there are in a country, the more their cultivated demands are taken as<br>
models by the rest of the population. The gap between the consumption of the university<br>
graduate and that of the average citizen is even wider in Russia, China, and Algeria than<br>
in the United States. Cars, airplane trips, and tape recorders confer more visible<br>
distinction in a socialist country, where only a degree, and not just money, can procure<br>
them.<br>The ability of the university to fix consumer goals is something new. In many countries<br>
the university acquired this power only in the sixties, as the delusion of equal access to<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 26<br>public education began to spread. Before that the university protected an individual's<br>
freedom of speech, but did not automatically convert his knowledge into wealth. To be a<br>
scholar in the Middle Ages meant to be poor, even a beggar. By virtue of his calling, the<br>
medieval scholar learned Latin, became an outsider worthy of the scorn as well as the<br>
esteem of peasant and prince, burgher and cleric. To get ahead in the world, the scholastic<br>
first had to enter it by joining the civil service, preferably that of the Church. The old<br>
university was a liberated zone for discovery and the discussion of ideas both new and<br>
old. Masters and students gathered to read the texts of other masters, now long dead, and<br>
the living words of the dead masters gave new perspective to the fallacies of the present<br>
day. The university was then a community of academic quest and endemic unrest.<br>In the modem multiversity this community has fled to the fringes, where it meets in a<br>
pad, a professor's office, or the chaplain's quarters. The structural purpose of the modem<br>
university has little to do with the traditional quest. Since Gutenberg, the exchange of<br>
disciplined, critical inquiry has, for the most part, moved from the "chair" into print. The<br>
modern university has forfeited its chance to provide a simple setting for encounters<br>
which are both autonomous and anarchic, focused yet unplanned and ebullient, and has<br>
chosen instead to manage the process by which so-called research and instruction are<br>
produced.<br>The American university, since Sputnik, has been trying to catch up with the body count<br>
of Soviet graduates. Now the Germans are abandoning their academic tradition and are<br>
building "campuses" in order to catch up with the Americans. During the present decade<br>
they want to increase their expenditure for grammar and high schools from 14 to 59<br>
billion DM, and more than triple expenditures for higher learning. The French propose by<br>
1980 to raise to 10 percent of their GNP the amount spent on schools, and the Ford<br>
Foundation has been pushing poor countries in Latin America to raise per capita expenses<br>
for "respect-able" graduates toward North American levels. Students see their studies as<br>
the investment with the highest monetary return, and nations see them as a key factor in<br>
development.<br>For the majority who primarily seek a college degree, the university has lost no prestige,<br>
but since 1968 it has visibly lost standing among its believers. Students refuse to prepare<br>
for war, pollution, and the perpetuation of prejudice. Teachers assist them in their<br>
challenge to the legitimacy of the government, its foreign policy, education, and the<br>
American way of life. More than a few reject degrees and prepare for a life in a<br>
counterculture, outside the certified society. They seem to choose the way of medieval<br>
Fraticelli and Alumbrados of the Reformation, the hippies and dropouts of their day.<br>
Others recognize the monopoly of the schools over the resources which they need to<br>
build a countersociety. They seek support from each other to live with integrity while<br>
submitting to the academic ritual. They form, so to speak, hotbeds of heresy right within<br>
the hierarchy.<br>Large parts of the general population, however, regard the modern mystic and the modem<br>
heresiarch with alarm. They threaten the consumer economy, democratic privilege, and<br>
the self-image of America. But they cannot be wished away. Fewer and fewer can be<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 27<br>reconverted by patience or coopted by subtlety for instance, by appointing them to teach<br>
their heresy. Hence the search for means which would make it possible either to get rid of<br>
dissident individuals or to reduce the importance of the university which serves them as a<br>
base for protest.<br>The students and faculty who question the legitimacy of the university, and do so at high<br>
personal cost, certainly do not feel that they are setting consumer standards or abetting a<br>
production system. Those who have founded such groups as the Committee of Concerned<br>
Asian Scholars and the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) have been<br>
among the most effective in changing radically the perceptions of the realities of foreign<br>
countries for millions of young people. Still others have tried to formulate Marxian<br>
interpretations of American society or have been among those responsible for the<br>
flowering of communes. Their achievements add new strength to the argument that the<br>
existence of the university is necessary to guarantee continued social criticism.<br>There is no question that at present the university offers a unique combination of<br>
circumstances which allows some of its members to criticize the whole of society. It<br>
provides time, mobility, access to peers and information, and a certain impunity-<br>
privileges not equally available to other segments of the population. But the university<br>
provides this freedom only to those who have already been deeply initiated into the<br>
consumer society and into the need for some kind of obligatory public schooling.<br>The school system today performs the threefold function common to powerful churches<br>
throughout history. It is simultaneously the repository of society's myth, the<br>
institutionalization of that myth's contradictions, and the locus of the ritual which<br>
reproduces and veils the disparities between myth and reality. Today the school system,<br>
and especially the university, provides ample opportunity for criticism of the myth and<br>
for rebellion against its institutional perversions. But the ritual which demands tolerance<br>
of the fundamental contradictions between myth and institution still goes largely<br>
unchallenged, for neither ideological criticism nor social action can bring about a new<br>
society. Only disenchantment with and detachment from the central social ritual and<br>
reform of that ritual can bring about radical change.<br>The American university has become the final stage of the most all encompassing<br>
initiation rite the world has ever known. No society in history has been able to survive<br>
without ritual or myth, but ours is the first which has needed such a dull, protracted,<br>
destructive, and expensive initiation into its myth. The contemporary world civilization is<br>
also the first one which has found it necessary to rationalize its fundamental initiation<br>
ritual in the name of education. We cannot begin a reform of education unless we first<br>
understand that neither individual learning nor social equality can be enhanced by the<br>
ritual of schooling. We cannot go beyond the consumer society unless we first understand<br>
that obligatory public schools inevitably reproduce such a society, no matter what is<br>
taught in them.<br>The project of demythologizing which I propose cannot be limited to the university alone.<br>
Any attempt to reform the university without attending to the system of which it is an<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 28<br>integral part is like trying to do urban renewal in New York City from the twelfth story<br>
up. Most current college-level reform looks like the building of high-rise slums. Only a<br>
generation which grows up without obligatory schools will be able to recreate the<br>
university.<br>The Myth of Institutionalized Values<br>School initiates, too, the Myth of Unending Consumption. This modem myth is<br>
grounded in the belief that process inevitably produces something of value and, therefore,<br>
production necessarily produces demand. School teaches us that instruction produces<br>
learning. The existence of schools produces the demand for schooling. Once we have<br>
learned to need school, all our activities tend to take the shape of client relationships to<br>
other specialized institutions. Once the self-taught man or woman has been discredited,<br>
all nonprofessional activity is rendered suspect. In school we are taught that valuable<br>
learning is the result of attendance; that the value of learning increases with the amount<br>
of input; and, finally, that this value can be measured and documented by grades and<br>
certificates.<br>In fact, learning is the human activity which least needs manipulation by others. Most<br>
learning is not the result of instruction. It is rather the result of unhampered participation<br>
in a meaningful setting. Most people learn best by being "with it," yet school makes them<br>
identify their personal, cognitive growth with elaborate planning and manipulation.<br>Once a man or woman has accepted the need for school, he or she is easy prey for other<br>
institutions. Once young people have allowed their imaginations to be formed by<br>
curricular instruction, they are conditioned to institutional planning of every sort.<br>
"Instruction" smothers the horizon of their imaginations. They cannot be betrayed, but<br>
only short-changed, because they have been taught to substitute expectations for hope.<br>
They will no longer be surprised, for good or ill, by other people, because they have been<br>
taught what to expect from every other person who has been taught as they were. This is<br>
true in the case of another person or in the case of a machine.<br>This transfer of responsibility from self to institution guarantees social regression,<br>
especially once it has been accepted as an obligation. So rebels against Alma Mater often<br>
"make it" into her faculty instead of growing into the courage to infect others with their<br>
personal teaching and to assume responsibility for the results. This suggests the<br>
possibility of a new Oedipus story-Oedipus the Teacher, who "makes" his mother in<br>
order to engender children with her. The man addicted to being taught seeks his security<br>
in compulsive teaching. The woman who experiences her knowledge as the result of a<br>
process wants to reproduce it in others.<br>The Myth of Measurement of Values<br>The institutionalized values school instills are quantified ones. School initiates young<br>
people into a world where everything can be measured, including their imaginations, and,<br>
indeed, man himself.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 29<br>But personal growth is not a measurable entity. It is growth in disciplined dissidence,<br>
which cannot be measured against any rod, or any curriculum, nor compared to someone<br>
else's achievement. In such learning one can emulate others only in imaginative<br>
endeavor, and follow in their footsteps rather than mimic their gait. The learning I prize is<br>
immeasurable re-creation.<br>School pretends to break learning up into subject "matters," to build into the pupil a<br>
curriculum made of these prefabricated blocks, and to gauge the result on an international<br>
scale. People who submit to the standard of others for the measure of their own personal<br>
growth soon apply the same ruler to themselves. They no longer have to be put in their<br>
place, but put themselves into their assigned slots, squeeze themselves into the niche<br>
which they have been taught to seek, and, in the very process, put their fellows into their<br>
places, too, until everybody and everything fits.<br>People who have been schooled down to size let unmeasured experience slip out of their<br>
hands. To them, what cannot be measured becomes secondary, threatening. They do not<br>
have to be robbed of their creativity. Under instruction, they have unlearned to "do" their<br>
thing or "be" themselves, and value only what has been made or could be made.<br>Once people have the idea schooled into them that values can be produced and measured,<br>
they tend to accept all kinds of rank' ings. There is a scale for the development of nations,<br>
another for the intelligence of babies, and even progress toward peace can be calculated<br>
according to body count. In a schooled world the road to happiness is paved with a<br>
consumer's index.<br>The Myth of Packaging Values<br>School sells curriculum— a bundle of goods made according to the same process and<br>
having the same structure as other merchandise. Curriculum production for most schools<br>
begins with allegedly scientific research, on whose basis educational engineers predict<br>
future demand and tools for the assembly line, within the limits set by budgets and<br>
taboos. The distributor-teacher delivers the finished product to the consumer pupil, whose<br>
reactions are carefully studied and charted to provide research data for the preparation of<br>
the next model, which may be "ungraded," "student-designed," "team-taught," "visually-<br>
aided," or "issue-centered."<br>The result of the curriculum production process looks like any other modern staple. It is a<br>
bundle of planned meanings, a package of values, a commodity whose "balanced appeal"<br>
makes it marketable to a sufficiently large number to justify the cost of production.<br>
Consumer-pupils are taught to make their desires conform to marketable values. Thus<br>
they are made to feel guilty if they do not behave according to the predictions of<br>
consumer research by getting the grades and certificates that will place them in the job<br>
category they have been led to expect.<br>Educators can justify more expensive curricula on the basis of their observation that<br>
learning difficulties rise proportionately with the cost of the curriculum. This is an<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 30<br>application of Parkinson's Law that work expands with the resources available to do it.<br>
This law can be verified on all levels of school: for instance, reading difficulties have<br>
been a major issue in French schools only since their per capita expenditures have<br>
approached U.S. levels of 1950-when reading difficulties became a major issue in U.S.<br>
schools.<br>In fact, healthy students often redouble their resistance to teaching as they find<br>
themselves more comprehensively manipulated. This resistance is due not to the<br>
authoritarian style of a public school or the seductive style of some free schools, but to<br>
the fundamental approach common to all schools-the idea that one person's judgment<br>
should determine what and when another person must learn.<br>The Myth of Self-Perpetuating Progress<br>Even when accompanied by declining returns in learning, paradoxically, rising per capita<br>
instructional costs increase the value of the pupil in his or her own eyes and on the<br>
market. At almost any cost, school pushes the pupil up to the level of competitive<br>
curricular consumption, into progress to ever higher levels. Expenditures to motivate the<br>
student to stay on in school skyrocket as he climbs the pyramid. On higher levels they are<br>
disguised as new football stadiums, chapels, or programs called International Education.<br>
If it teaches nothing else, school teaches the value of escalation: the value of the<br>
American way of doing things.<br>The Vietnam war fits the logic of the moment. Its success has been measured by the<br>
numbers of persons effectively treated by cheap bullets delivered at immense cost, and<br>
this brutal calculus is unashamedly called "body count." Just as business is business, the<br>
never-ending accumulation of money, so war is killing, the never-ending accumulation of<br>
dead bodies. In like manner, education is schooling, and this open-ended process is<br>
counted in pupil-hours. The various processes are irreversible and self-justifying. By<br>
economic standards the country gets richer and richer. By death-accounting standards the<br>
nation goes on winning its war forever. And by school standards the population becomes<br>
increasingly educated.<br>School programs hunger for progressive intake of instruction, but even if the hunger leads<br>
to steady absorption, it never yields the joy of knowing something to one's satisfaction.<br>
Each subject comes packaged with the instruction to go on consuming one "offering"<br>
after another, and last year's wrapping is always obsolete for this year's consumer. The<br>
textbook racket builds on this demand. Educational reformers promise each new<br>
generation the latest and the best, and the public is schooled into demanding what they<br>
offer. Both the dropout who is forever reminded of what he missed and the graduate who<br>
is made to feel inferior to the new breed of student know exactly where they stand in the<br>
ritual of rising deceptions and continue to support a society which euphemistically calls<br>
the widening frustration gap a "revolution of rising expectations."<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page #31<br>But growth conceived as open-ended consumption-eternal progress-can never lead to<br>
maturity. Commitment to unlimited quantitative increase vitiates the possibility of<br>
organic development.<br>Ritual Game and the New World Religion<br>The school leaving age in developed nations outpaces the rise in life expectancy. The<br>
two curves will intersect in a decade and create a problem for Jessica Mitford and<br>
professionals concerned with "terminal education." I am reminded of the late Middle<br>
Ages, when the demand for Church services outgrew a lifetime, and "Purgatory" was<br>
created to purify souls under the pope's control before they could enter eternal peace.<br>
Logically, this led first to a trade in indulgences and then to an attempt at Reformation.<br>
The Myth of Unending Consumption now takes the place of belief in life everlasting.<br>Arnold Toynbee has pointed out that the decadence of a great culture is usually<br>
accompanied by the rise of a new World Church which extends hope to the domestic<br>
proletariat while serving the needs of a new warrior class. School seems eminently suited<br>
to be the World Church of our decaying culture. No institution could better veil from its<br>
participants the deep discrepancy between social principles and social reality in today's<br>
world. Secular, scientific, and death-denying, it is of a piece with the modern mood. Its<br>
classical, critical veneer makes it appear pluralist if not antireligious. Its curriculum both<br>
defines science and is itself defined by so-called scientific research. No one completes<br>
school— yet. It never closes its doors on anyone without first offering him one more<br>
chance: at remedial, adult, and continuing education.<br>School serves as an effective creator and sustainer of social myth because of its structure<br>
as a ritual game of graded promotions. Introduction into this gambling ritual is much<br>
more important than what or how something is taught. It is the game itself that schools,<br>
that gets into the blood and becomes a habit. A whole society is initiated into the Myth of<br>
Unending Consumption of services. This happens to the degree that token participation in<br>
the open-ended ritual is made compulsory and compulsive everywhere. School directs<br>
ritual rivalry into an international game which obliges competitors to blame the world's<br>
ills on those who cannot or will not play. School is a ritual of initiation which introduces<br>
the neophyte to the sacred race of progressive consumption, a ritual of propitiation whose<br>
academic priests mediate between the faithful and the gods of privilege and power, a<br>
ritual of expiation which sacrifices its dropouts, branding them as scapegoats of<br>
underdevelopment .<br>Even those who spend at best a few years in school-and this is the overwhelming<br>
majority in Latin America, Asia, and Africa-leam to feel guilty because of their<br>
underconsumption of schooling. In Mexico six grades of school are legally obligatory.<br>
Children bom into the lower economic third have only two chances in three to make it<br>
into the first grade. If they make it, they have four chances in one hundred to finish<br>
obligatory schooling by the sixth grade. If they are born into the middle third group, their<br>
chances increase to twelve out of a hundred. With these rules, Mexico is more successful<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 32<br>than most of the other twenty-five Latin American republics in providing public<br>
education.<br>Everywhere, all children know that they were given a chance, albeit an unequal one, in an<br>
obligatory lottery, and the presumed equality of the international standard now<br>
compounds their original poverty with the self-inflicted discrimination accepted by the<br>
dropout. They have been schooled to the belief in rising expectations and can now<br>
rationalize their growing frustration outside school by accepting their rejection from<br>
scholastic grace. They are excluded from Heaven because, once baptized, they did not go<br>
to church. Bom in original sin, they are baptized into first grade, but go to Gehenna<br>
(which in Hebrew means "slum") because of their personal faults. As Max Weber traced<br>
the social effects of the belief that salvation belonged to those who accumulated wealth,<br>
we can now observe that grace is reserved for those who accumulate years in school.<br>The Coming Kingdom: The Universalization of Expectations<br>School combines the expectations of the consumer expressed in its claims with the<br>
beliefs of the producer expressed in its ritual, It is a liturgical expression of a world- wide<br>
"cargo cult," reminiscent of the cults which swept Melanesia in the forties, which injected<br>
cultists with the belief that if they but put on a black tie over their naked torsos, Jesus<br>
would arrive in a steamer bearing an icebox, a pair of trousers, and a sewing machine for<br>
each believer.<br>School fuses the growth in humiliating dependence on a master with the growth in the<br>
futile sense of omnipotence that is so typical of the pupil who wants to go out and teach<br>
all nations to save themselves. The ritual is tailored to the stern work habits of the<br>
hardhats, and its purpose is to celebrate the myth of an earthly paradise of never-ending<br>
consumption, which is the only hope for the wretched and dispossessed.<br>Epidemics of insatiable this-worldly expectations have occurred throughout history,<br>
especially among colonized and marginal groups in all cultures. Jews in the Roman<br>
Empire had their Essenes and Jewish messiahs, serfs in the Reformation their Thomas<br>
MYnzer, dispossessed Indians from Paraguay to Dakota their infectious dancers. These<br>
sects were always led by a prophet, and limited their promises to a chosen few. The<br>
school-induced expectation of the kingdom, on the other hand, is impersonal rather than<br>
prophetic, and universal rather than local. Man has become the engineer of his own<br>
messiah and promises the unlimited rewards of science to those who submit to<br>
progressive engineering for his reign.<br>The New Alienation<br>School is not only the New World Religion. It is also the world's fastest-growing labor<br>
market. The engineering of consumers has become the economy's principal growth<br>
sector. As production costs decrease in rich nations, there is an increasing concentration<br>
of both capital and labor in the vast enterprise of equipping man for disciplined<br>
consumption. During the past decade capital investments directly related to the school<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 33<br>system rose even faster than expenditures for defense. Disarmament would only<br>
accelerate the process by which the learning industry moves to the center of the national<br>
economy. School gives unlimited opportunity for legitimated waste, so long as its<br>
destructiveness goes unrecognized and the cost of palliatives goes up.<br>If we add those engaged in full-time teaching to those in full-time attendance, we realize<br>
that this so-called superstructure has become society's major employer. In the United<br>
States sixty-two million people are in school and eighty million at work elsewhere. This<br>
is often forgotten by neo-Marxist analysts who say that the process of deschooling must<br>
be postponed or bracketed until other disorders, traditionally understood as more<br>
fundamental, are corrected by an economic and political revolution. Only if school is<br>
understood as an industry can revolutionary strategy be planned realistically. For Marx,<br>
the cost of producing demands for commodities was barely significant. Today most<br>
human labor is engaged in the production of demands that can be satisfied by industry<br>
which makes intensive use of capital. Most of this is done in school.<br>Alienation, in the traditional scheme, was a direct consequence of work's becoming<br>
wage-labor which deprived man of the opportunity to create and be recreated. Now<br>
young people are prealienated by schools that isolate them while they pretend to be both<br>
producers and consumers of their own knowledge, which is conceived of as a commodity<br>
put on the market in school. School makes alienation preparatory to life, thus depriving<br>
education of reality and work of creativity. School prepares for the alienating<br>
institutionalization of life by teaching the need to be taught. Once this lesson is learned,<br>
people lose their incentive to grow in independence; they no longer find relatedness<br>
attractive, and close themselves off to the surprises which life offers when it is not<br>
predetermined by institutional definition. And school directly or indirectly employs a<br>
major portion of the population. School either keeps people for life or makes sure that<br>
they will fit into some institution.<br>The New World Church is the knowledge industry, both purveyor of opium and the<br>
workbench during an increasing number of the years of an individual's life. Deschooling<br>
is, therefore, at the root of any movement for human liberation.<br>The Revolutionary Potential of Deschooling<br>Of course, school is not, by any means, the only modern institution which has as its<br>
primary purpose the shaping of man's vision of reality. The hidden curriculum of family<br>
life, draft, health care, so-called professionalism, or of the media play an important part in<br>
the institutional manipulation of man's world-vision, language, and demands. But school<br>
enslaves more profoundly and more systematically, since only school is credited with the<br>
principal function of forming critical judgment, and, paradoxically, tries to do so by<br>
making learning about oneself, about others, and about nature depend on a prepackaged<br>
process. School touches us so intimately that none of us can expect to be liberated from it<br>
by something else.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 34<br>Many self-styled revolutionaries are victims of school. They see even "liberation" as the<br>
product of an institutional process. Only liberating oneself from school will dispel such<br>
illusions. The discovery that most learning requires no teaching can be neither<br>
manipulated nor planned. Each of us is personally responsible for his or her own<br>
deschooling, and only we have the power to do it. No one can be excused if he fails to<br>
liberate himself from schooling. People could not free themselves from the Crown until at<br>
least some of them had freed themselves from the established Church. They cannot free<br>
themselves from progressive consumption until they free themselves from obligatory<br>
school.<br>We are all involved in schooling, from both the side of production and that of<br>
consumption. We are superstitiously convinced that good learning can and should be<br>
produced in us-and that we can produce it in others. Our attempt to withdraw from the<br>
concept of school will reveal the resistance we find in ourselves when we try to renounce<br>
limitless consumption and the pervasive presumption that others can be manipulated for<br>
their own good. No one is fully exempt from the exploitation of others in the schooling<br>
process.<br>School is both the largest and the most anonymous employer of all. Indeed, the school is<br>
the best example of a new kind of enterprise, succeeding the guild, the factory, and the<br>
corporation. The multinational corporations which have dominated the economy are now<br>
being complemented, and may one day be replaced, by supemationally planned service<br>
agencies. These enterprises present their services in ways that make all men feel obliged<br>
to consume them. They are internationally standardized, redefining the value of their<br>
services periodically and everywhere at approximately the same rhythm.<br>"Transportation" relying on new cars and superhighways serves the same institutionally<br>
packaged need for comfort, prestige, speed, and gadgetry, whether its components are<br>
produced by the state or not. The apparatus of "medical care" defines a peculiar kind of<br>
health, whether the service is paid for by the state or by the individual. Graded promotion<br>
in order to obtain diplomas fits the student for a place on the same international pyramid<br>
of qualified manpower, no matter who directs the school.<br>In all these cases employment is a hidden benefit: the driver of a private automobile, the<br>
patient who submits to hospitalization, or the pupil in the schoolroom must now be seen<br>
as part of a new class of "employees." A liberation movement which starts in school, and<br>
yet is grounded in the awareness of teachers and pupils as simultaneously exploiters and<br>
exploited, could foreshadow the revolutionary strategies of the future; for a radical<br>
program of deschooling could train youth in the new style of revolution needed to<br>
challenge a social system featuring obligatory "health," "wealth," and "security."<br>The risks of a revolt against school are unforeseeable, but they are not as horrible as those<br>
of a revolution starting in any other major institution. School is not yet organized for self-<br>
protection as effectively as a nation-state, or even a large corporation. Liberation from the<br>
grip of schools could be bloodless. The weapons of the truant officer and his allies in the<br>
courts and employment agencies might take very cruel measures against the individual<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 35<br>offender, especially if he or she were poor, but they might turn out to be powerless<br>
against the surge of a mass movement.<br>School has become a social problem; it is being attacked on all sides, and citizens and<br>
their governments sponsor unconventional experiments all over the world. They resort to<br>
unusual statistical devices in order to keep faith and save face. The mood among some<br>
educators is much like the mood among Catholic bishops after the Vatican Council. The<br>
curricula of so-called "free schools" resemble the liturgies of folk and rock masses. The<br>
demands of high-school students to have a say in choosing their teachers are as strident as<br>
those of parishioners demanding to select their pastors. But the stakes for society are<br>
much higher if a significant minority loses its faith in schooling. This would endanger the<br>
survival not only of the economic order built on the coproduction of goods and demands,<br>
but equally of the political order built on the nation-state into which students are<br>
delivered by the school.<br>Our options are clear enough. Either we continue to believe that institutionalized learning<br>
is a product which justifies unlimited investment or we rediscover that legislation and<br>
planning and investment, if they have any place in formal education, should be used<br>
mostly to tear down the barriers that now impede opportunities for learning, which can<br>
only be a personal activity.<br>If we do not challenge the assumption that valuable knowledge is a commodity which<br>
under certain circumstances may be forced into the consumer, society will be<br>
increasingly dominated by sinister pseudo schools and totalitarian managers of<br>
information. Pedagogical therapists will drug their pupils more in order to teach them<br>
better, and students will drug themselves more to gain relief from the pressures of<br>
teachers and the race for certificates. Increasingly larger numbers of bureaucrats will<br>
presume to pose as teachers. The language of the schoolman has already been coopted by<br>
the adman. Now the general and the policeman try to dignify their professions by<br>
masquerading as educators. In a schooled society, warmaking and civil repression find an<br>
educational rationale. Pedagogical warfare in the style of Vietnam will be increasingly<br>
justified as the only way of teaching people the superior value of unending progress.<br>Repression will be seen as a missionary effort to hasten the coming of the mechanical<br>
Messiah. More and more countries will resort to the pedagogical torture already<br>
implemented in Brazil and Greece. This pedagogical torture is not used to extract<br>
information or to satisfy the psychic needs of sadists. It relies on random terror to break<br>
the integrity of an entire population and make it plastic material for the teachings<br>
invented by technocrats. The totally destructive and constantly progressive nature of<br>
obligatory instruction will fulfill its ultimate logic unless we begin to liberate ourselves<br>
right now from our pedagogical hubris, our belief that man can do what God cannot,<br>
namely, manipulate others for their own salvation.<br>Many people are just awakening to the inexorable destruction which present production<br>
trends imply for the environment, but individuals have only very limited power to change<br>
these trends. The manipulation of men and women begun in school has also reached a<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 36<br>point of no return, and most people are still unaware of it. They still encourage school<br>
reform, as Henry Ford II proposes less poisonous automobiles.<br>Daniel Bell says that our epoch is characterized by an extreme disjunction between<br>
cultural and social structures, the one being devoted to apocalyptic attitudes, the other to<br>
technocratic decision-making. This is certainly true for many educational reformers, who<br>
feel impelled to condemn almost everything which characterizes modern schools-and at<br>
the same time propose new schools.<br>In his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn argues that such dissonance<br>
inevitably precedes the emergence of a new cognitive paradigm. The facts reported by<br>
those who observed free fall, by those who returned from the other side of the earth, and<br>
by those who used the new telescope did not fit the Ptolemaic world view. Quite<br>
suddenly, the Newtonian paradigm was accepted. The dissonance which characterizes<br>
many of the young today is not so much cognitive as a matter of attitudes— a feeling about<br>
what a tolerable society cannot be like. What is surprising about this dissonance is the<br>
ability of a very large number of people to tolerate it.<br>The capacity to pursue incongruous goals requires an explanation. According to Max<br>
Gluckman, all societies have procedures to hide such dissonances from their members.<br>He suggests that this is the purpose of ritual. Rituals can hide from their participants even<br>
discrepancies and conflicts between social principle and social organization. As long as<br>
an individual is not explicitly conscious of the ritual character of the process through<br>
which he was initiated to the forces which shape his cosmos, he cannot break the spell<br>
and shape a new cosmos. As long as we are not aware of the ritual through which school<br>
shapes the progressive consumer— the economy's major resource— we cannot break the<br>
spell of this economy and shape a new one.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 37<br>4<br>Institutional Spectrum<br>Most utopian schemes and futuristic scenarios call for new and costly technologies,<br>
which would have to be sold to rich and poor nations alike. Herman Kahn has found<br>
pupils in Venezuela, Argentina, and Colombia. The pipe dreams of Sergio Bernardes for<br>
his Brazil of the year 2000 sparkle with more new machinery than is now possessed by<br>
the United States, which by then will be weighted down with the antiquated missile sites,<br>
jetports, and cities of the sixties and seventies. Futurists inspired by Buckminster Fuller<br>
would depend on cheaper and more exotic devices. They count on the acceptance of a<br>
new but possible technology that would apparently allow us to make more with less-<br>
lightweight monorails rather than supersonic transport; vertical living rather than<br>
horizontal sprawling. All of today's futuristic planners seek to make economically<br>
feasible what is technically possible while refusing to face the inevitable social<br>
consequence: the increased craving of all men for goods and services that will remain the<br>
privilege of a few.<br>I believe that a desirable future depends on our deliberately choosing a life of action over<br>
a life of consumption, on our engendering a life style which will enable us to be<br>
spontaneous, independent, yet related to each other, rather than maintaining a life style<br>
which only allows us to make and unmake, produce and consume-a style of life which is<br>
merely a way station on the road to the depletion and pollution of the environment. The<br>
future depends more upon our choice of institutions which support a life of action than on<br>
our developing new ideologies and technologies. We need a set of criteria which will<br>
permit us to recognize those institutions which support personal growth rather than<br>
addiction, as well as the will to invest our techno-logical resources preferentially in such<br>
institutions of growth.<br>The choice is between two radically opposed institutional types, both of which are<br>
exemplified in certain existing institutions, although one type so characterizes the<br>
contemporary period, as to almost define it. This dominant type I would propose to call<br>
the manipulative institution. The other type also exists, but only precariously. The<br>
institutions which fit it are humbler and less noticeable; yet I take them as models for a<br>
more desirable future. I call them "convivial" and suggest placing them at the left of an<br>
institutional spectrum, both to show that there are institutions which fall between the<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 38<br>extremes and to illustrate how historical institutions can change color as they shift from<br>
facilitating activity to organizing production.<br>Generally, such a spectrum, moving from left to right, has been used to characterize men<br>
and their ideologies, not our social institutions and their styles. This categorization of<br>
men, whether as individuals or in groups, often generates more heat than light. Weighty<br>
objections can be raised against using an ordinary convention in an unusual fashion, but<br>
by doing so I hope to shift the terms of the discussion from a sterile to a fertile plane. It<br>
will become evident that men of the left are not always characterized by their opposition<br>
to the manipulative institutions, which I locate to the right on the spectrum.<br>The most influential modern institutions crowd up at the right of the spectrum. Law<br>
enforcement has moved there, as it has shifted from the hands of the sheriff to those of<br>
the FBI and the Pentagon. Modern warfare has become a highly professional enterprise<br>
whose business is killing. It has reached the point where its efficiency is measured in<br>
body counts. Its peace-keeping potential depends on its ability to convince friend and foe<br>
of the nation's unlimited death-dealing power. Modern bullets and chemicals are so<br>
effective that a few cents' worth, properly delivered to the intended "client," unfailingly<br>
kill or maim. But delivery costs rise vertiginously; the cost of a dead Vietnamese went<br>
from $360,000 in 1967 to $450,000 in 1969. Only economies on a scale approaching race<br>
suicide would render modem warfare economically efficient. The boomerang effect in<br>
war is becoming more obvious: the higher the body count of dead Vietnamese, the more<br>
enemies the United States acquires around the world; likewise, the more the United States<br>
must spend to create another manipulative institution— cynically dubbed "pacification" in<br>
a futile effort to absorb the side effects of war.<br>At this same extreme on the spectrum we also find social agencies which specialize in the<br>
manipulation of their clients. Like the military, they tend to develop effects contrary to<br>
their aims as the scope of their operations increases. These social institutions are equally<br>
counterproductive, but less obviously so. Many assume a therapeutic and compassionate<br>
image to mask this paradoxical effect. For example, jails, up until two centuries ago,<br>
served as a means of detaining men until they were sentenced, maimed, killed, or exiled,<br>
and were sometimes deliberately used as a form of torture. Only recently have we begun<br>
to claim that locking people up in cages will have a beneficial effect on their character<br>
and behavior. Now quite a few people are beginning to understand that jail increases both<br>
the quality and the quantity of criminals, that, in fact, it often creates them out of mere<br>
nonconformists. Far fewer people, however, seem to understand that mental hospitals,<br>
nursing homes, and orphan asylums do much the same thing. These institutions provide<br>
their clients with the destructive self-image of the psychotic, the overaged, or the waif,<br>
and provide a rationale for the existence of entire professions, just as jails produce<br>
income for wardens. Membership in the institutions found at this extreme of the spectrum<br>
is achieved in two ways, both coercive: by forced commitment or by selective service.<br>At the opposite extreme of the spectrum lie institutions distinguished by spontaneous use-<br>
the "convivial" institutions. Telephone link-ups, subway lines, mail routes, public<br>
markets and exchanges do not require hard or soft sells to induce their clients to use<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 39<br>them. Sewage systems, drinking water, parks, and side-walks are institutions men use<br>
without having to be institutionally convinced that it is to their advantage to do so. Of<br>
course, all institutions require some regulation. But the opera, tion of institutions which<br>
exist to be used rather than to produce something requires rules of an entirely different<br>
nature from those required by treatment-institutions, which are manipulative. The rules<br>
which govern institutions for use have mainly the purpose of avoiding abuses which<br>
would frustrate their general accessibility. Sidewalks must be kept free of obstructions,<br>
the industrial use of drinking water must be held within limits, and ball playing must be<br>
restricted to special areas within a park. At present we need legislation to limit the abuse<br>
of our telephone lines by computers, the abuse of mail service by advertisers, and the<br>
pollution of our sewage systems by industrial wastes. The regulation of convivial<br>
institutions sets limits to their use; as one moves from the convivial to the manipulative<br>
end of the spectrum, the rules progressively call for unwilling consumption or<br>
participation. The different cost of acquiring clients is just one of the characteristics<br>
which distinguish convivial from manipulative institutions.<br>At both extremes of the spectrum we find service institutions, but on the right the service<br>
is imposed manipulation, and the client is made the victim of advertising, aggression,<br>
indoctrination, imprisonment, or electroshock. On the left the service is amplified<br>
opportunity within formally defined limits, while the client remains a free agent. Right-<br>
wing institutions tend to be highly complex and costly production processes in which<br>
much of the elaboration and expense is concerned with convincing consumers that they<br>
cannot live without the product or the treatment offered by the institution. Left-wing<br>
institutions tend to be networks which facilitate client-initiated communication or<br>
cooperation.<br>The manipulative institutions of the right are either socially or psychologically<br>
"addictive." Social addiction, or escalation, consists in the tendency to prescribe<br>
increased treatment if smaller quantities have not yielded the desired results. Psycho-<br>
logical addiction, or habituation, results when consumers become hooked on the need for<br>
more and more of the process or product. The self-activated institutions of the left tend to<br>
be self-limiting. Unlike production processes which identify satisfaction with the mere<br>
act of consumption, these networks serve a purpose beyond their own repeated use. An<br>
individual picks up the telephone when he wants to say something to someone else, and<br>
hangs up when the desired communication is over. He does not, teen-agers excepted, use<br>
the telephone for the sheer pleasure of talking into the receiver. If the telephone is not the<br>
best way to get in touch, people will write a letter or take a trip. Right-wing institutions,<br>
as we can see clearly in the case of schools, both invite compulsively repetitive use and<br>
frustrate alternative ways of achieving similar results.<br>Toward, but not at, the left on the institutional spectrum, we can locate enterprises which<br>
compete with others in their own field, but have not begun notably to engage in<br>
advertising. Here we find hand laundries, small bakeries, hairdressers, and-to speak of<br>
professionals-some lawyers and music teachers. Characteristically left of center, then, are<br>
self-employed persons who have institutionalized their services but not their publicity.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 40<br>They acquire clients through their personal touch and the comparative quality of their<br>
services.<br>Hotels and cafeterias are somewhat closer to the center. The big chains like Hilton-which<br>
spend huge amounts on selling their image-often behave as if they were running<br>
institutions of the right. Yet Hilton and Sheraton enterprises do not usually offer anything<br>
more-in fact, they often give less-than similarly priced, independently managed lodgings.<br>
Essentially, a hotel sign beckons to a traveler in the manner of a road sign. It says, "Stop,<br>
here is a bed for you," rather than, "You should prefer a hotel bed to a park bench!"<br>The producers of staples and most perishable consumer goods belong in the middle of our<br>
spectrum. They fill generic demands and add to the cost of production and distribution<br>
whatever the market will bear in advertising costs for publicity and special packaging.<br>The more basic the product-be it goods or services-the more does competition tend to<br>
limit the sales cost of the item.<br>Most manufacturers of consumer goods have moved much further to the right. Both<br>
directly and indirectly, they produce demands for accessories which boost real purchase<br>
price far beyond production cost. General Motors and Ford produce means of<br>
transportation, but they also, and more importantly, manipulate public taste in such a way<br>
that the need for transportation is expressed as a demand for private cars rather than<br>
public buses. They sell the desire to control a machine, to race at high speeds in luxurious<br>
comfort, while also offering the fantasy at the end of the road. What they sell, however, is<br>
not just a matter of uselessly big motors, superfluous gadgetry, or the new extras forced<br>
on the manufacturers by Ralph Nader and the clean-air lobbyists. The list price includes<br>
souped-up engines, air-conditioning, safety belts, and exhaust controls; but other costs<br>
not openly declared to the driver are also involved: the corporation's advertising and sales<br>
expenses, fuel, maintenance and parts, insurance, interest on credit, as well as less<br>
tangible costs like loss of time, temper, and breathable air in our traffic-congested cities.<br>An especially interesting corollary to our discussion of socially useful institutions is the<br>
system of "public" highways. This major element of the total cost of automobiles<br>
deserves lengthier treatment, since it leads directly to the rightist institution in which I am<br>
most interested, namely, the school.<br>False Public Utilities<br>The highway system is a network for locomotion across relatively large distances. As a<br>
network, it appears to belong on the left of the institutional spectrum. But here we must<br>
make a distinction which will clarify both the nature of highways and the nature of true<br>
public utilities. Genuinely all-purpose roads are true public utilities. Superhighways are<br>
private preserves, the cost of which has been partially foisted upon the public.<br>Telephone, postal, and highway systems are all networks, and none of them is free.<br>Access to the telephone network is limited by time charges on each call. These rates are<br>
relatively small and could be reduced without changing the nature of the system. Use of<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page #41<br>the telephone system is not in the least limited by what is transmitted, although it is best<br>
used by those who can speak coherent sentences in the language of the other party-an<br>
ability universally possessed by those who wish to use the network. Postage is usually<br>
cheap. Use of the postal system is slightly limited by the price of pen and paper, and<br>
somewhat more by the ability to write. Still, when someone who does not know how to<br>
write has a relative or friend to whom he can dictate a letter, the postal system is at his<br>
service, as it is if he wants to ship a recorded tape.<br>The highway system does not similarly become available to someone who merely learns<br>
to drive. The telephone and postal networks exist to serve those who wish to use them,<br>
while the highway system mainly serves as an accessory to the private automobile. The<br>
former are true public utilities, whereas the latter is a public service to the owners of cars,<br>
trucks, and buses. Public utilities exist for the sake of communication among men;<br>
highways, like other institutions of the right, exist for the sake of a product. Auto<br>
manufacturers, we have already observed, produce simultaneously both cars and the<br>
demand for cars. They also produce the demand for multilane highways, bridges, and<br>
oilfields. The private car is the focus of a cluster of right-wing institutions. The high cost<br>
of each element is dictated by elaboration of the basic product, and to sell the basic<br>
product is to hook society on the entire package.<br>To plan a highway system as a true public utility would discriminate against those for<br>
whom velocity and individualized comfort are the primary transportation values, in favor<br>
of those who value fluidity and destination. It is the difference between a far-flung<br>
network with maximum access for travelers and one which offers only privileged access<br>
to restricted areas.<br>Transferring a modern institution to the developing nations provides the acid test of its<br>
quality. In very poor countries roads are usually just good enough to permit transit by<br>
special, high-axle trucks loaded with groceries, livestock, or people. This kind of country<br>
should use its limited resources to build a spiderweb of trails extending to every region<br>
and should restrict imports to two or three different models of highly durable vehicles<br>
which can manage all trails at low speed. This would simplify maintenance and the<br>
stocking of spare parts, permit the operation of these vehicles around the clock, and<br>
provide maximum fluidity and choice of destination to all citizens. This would require the<br>
engineering of all-purpose vehicles with the simplicity of the Model T, making use of the<br>
most modern alloys to guarantee durability, with a built-in speed limit of not more than<br>
fifteen miles per hour, and strong enough to run on the roughest terrain. Such vehicles are<br>
not on the market because there is no demand for them. As a matter of fact, such a<br>
demand would have to be cultivated, quite possibly under the protection of strict<br>
legislation. At present, whenever such a demand is even slightly felt, it is quickly snuffed<br>
out by counterpublicity aimed at universal sales of the machines which currently extract<br>
from U.S. taxpayers the money needed for building superhighways.<br>In order to "improve" transportation, all countries-even the poorest-now plan highway<br>
systems designed for the passenger cars and high-speed trailers which fit the velocity-<br>
conscious minority of producers and consumers in the elite classes. This approach is<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 42<br>frequently rationalized as a saving of the most precious resource of a poor country: the<br>
time of the doctor, the school inspector, or the public administrator. These men, of<br>
course, serve almost exclusively the same people who have, or hope one day to have, a<br>
car. Local taxes and scarce international exchange are wasted on false public utilities.<br>"Modem" technology transferred to poor countries falls into three large categories:<br>
goods, factories which make them, and service institutions— principally schools— which<br>
make men into modem producers and consumers. Most countries spend by far the largest<br>
proportion of their budget on schools. The school-made graduates then create a demand<br>
for other conspicuous utilities, such as industrial power, paved highways, modern<br>
hospitals, and airports, and these in turn create a market for the goods made for rich<br>
countries and, after a while, the tendency to import obsolescent factories to produce them.<br>Of all "false utilities," school is the most insidious. Highway systems produce only a<br>
demand for cars. Schools create a demand for the entire set of modern institutions which<br>
crowd the right end of the spectrum. A man who questioned the need for high, ways<br>
would be written off as a romantic; the man who questions the need for school is<br>
immediately attacked as either heartless or imperialist.<br>Schools as False Public Utilities<br>Like highways, schools, at first glance, give the impression of being equally open to all<br>
comers. They are, in fact, open only to those who consistently renew their credentials.<br>Just as highways create the impression that their present level of cost per year is<br>
necessary if people are to move, so schools are presumed essential for attaining the<br>
competence required by a society which uses modern technology. We have exposed<br>
speedways as spurious public utilities by noting their dependence on private automobiles.<br>
Schools are based upon the equally spurious hypothesis that learning is the result of<br>
curricular teaching.<br>Highways result from a perversion of the desire and need for mobility into the demand<br>
for a private car. Schools themselves pervert the natural inclination to grow and learn into<br>
the demand for instruction. Demand for manufactured maturity is a far greater abnegation<br>
of self-initiated activity than the demand for manufactured goods. Schools are not only to<br>
the right of highways and cars; they belong near the extreme of the institutional spectrum<br>
occupied by total asylums. Even the producers of body counts kill only bodies. By<br>
making men abdicate the responsibility for their own growth, school leads many to a kind<br>
of spiritual suicide.<br>Highways are paid for in part by those who use them, since tolls and gasoline taxes are<br>
extracted only from drivers. School, on the other hand, is a perfect system of regressive<br>
taxation, where the privileged graduates ride on the back of the entire paying public.<br>
School puts a head tax on promotion. The underconsumption of highway mileage is not<br>
nearly so costly as the underconsumption of schooling. The man who does not own a car<br>
in Los Angeles may be almost immobilized, but if he can somehow manage to reach a<br>
work place, he can get and hold a job. The school dropout has no alternative route. The<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 43<br>suburbanite with his new Lincoln and his country cousin who drives a beat-up jalopy get<br>
essentially the same use out of the highway, even though one man's car costs thirty times<br>
more than the other's. The value of a man's schooling is a function of the number of years<br>
he has completed and of the costliness of the schools he has attended. The law compels<br>
no one to drive, whereas it obliges everyone to go to school.<br>The analysis of institutions according to their present placement on a left-right continuum<br>
enables me to clarify my belief that fundamental social change must begin with a change<br>
of consciousness about institutions and to explain why the dimension of a viable future<br>
turns on the rejuvenation of institutional style.<br>During the sixties institutions born in different decades since the French Revolution<br>
simultaneously reached old age; public school systems founded in the time of Jefferson<br>
or of AtatYrk, along with others which started after World War II, all became<br>
bureaucratic, self-justifying, and manipulative. The same thing happened to systems of<br>
social security, to labor unions, major churches and diplomacies, the care of the aged, and<br>
the disposal of the dead.<br>Today, for instance, the school systems of Colombia, Britain, the U.S.S.R., and the U.S.<br>
resemble each other more closely than U.S. schools of the late 1890's resembled either<br>
today's or their contemporaries in Russia. Today all schools are obligatory, open-ended,<br>
and competitive. The same convergence in institutional style affects health care,<br>
merchandising, personnel administration, and political life. All these institutional<br>
processes tend to pile up at the manipulative end of the spectrum.<br>A merger of world bureaucracies results from this convergence of institutions. The style,<br>
the ranking systems, and the paraphernalia (from textbook to computer) are standardized<br>
on the planning boards of Costa Rica or Afghanistan after the model of Western Europe.<br>Everywhere these bureaucracies seem to focus on the same task: promoting the growth of<br>
institutions of the right. They are concerned with the making of things, the making of<br>
ritual rules, and the making-and reshaping— of "executive truth," the ideology or fiat<br>
which establishes the current value which should be attributed to their product.<br>
Technology provides these bureaucracies with increasing power on the right hand of<br>
society. The left hand of society seems to wither, not because technology is less capable<br>
of increasing the range of human action, and providing time for the play of individual<br>
imagination and personal creativity, but because such use of technology does not increase<br>
the power of an elite which administers it. The postmaster has no control over the<br>
substantive use of the mails, the switchboard operator or Bell Telephone executive has no<br>
power to stop adultery, murder, or subversion from being planned over his network.<br>At stake in the choice between the institutional right and left is the very nature of human<br>
life. Man must choose whether to be rich in things or in the freedom to use them. He must<br>
choose between alternate styles of life and related production schedules.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 44<br>Aristotle had already discovered that "making and acting" are different, so different, in<br>
fact, that one never includes the other. "For neither is acting a way of making-nor making<br>a way of truly acting. Architecture [techne] is a way of making of bringing<br>something into being whose origin is in the maker and not in the thing. Making has<br>
always an end other than itself, action not; for good action itself is its end. Perfection in<br>
making is an art, perfection in acting is a virtue." [Nichomachean Ethics, 1 1 40.] The<br>
word which Aristotle employed for making was "poesis, " and the word he employed for<br>
doing, "praxis. " A move to the right implies that an institution is being restructured to<br>
increase its ability to "make," while as it moves to the left, it is being restructured to<br>
allow increased "doing" or "praxis. " Modern technology has increased the ability of man<br>
to relinquish the "making" of things to machines, and his potential time for "acting"" has<br>
increased. "Making" the necessities of life has ceased to take up his time. Unemployment<br>
is the result of this modernization: it is the idleness of a man for whom there is nothing to<br>
"make" and who does not know what to "do"— that is, how to "act." Unemployment is the<br>
sad idleness of a man who, contrary to Aristotle, believes that making things, or working,<br>
is virtuous and that idleness is bad. Unemployment is the experience of the man who has<br>
succumbed to the Protestant ethic. Leisure, according to Weber, is necessary for man to<br>
be able to work. For Aristotle, work is necessary for man to have leisure.<br>Technology provides man with discretionary time he can fill either with making or with<br>
doing. The choice between sad unemployment and joyful leisure is now open for the<br>
entire culture. It depends on the institutional style the culture chooses. This choice would<br>
have been unthinkable in an ancient culture built either on peasant agriculture or on<br>
slavery. It has become inevitable for postindustrial man.<br>One way to fill available time is to stimulate increased demands for the consumption of<br>
goods and, simultaneously, for the production of services. The former implies an<br>
economy which provides an ever-growing array of ever newer things which can be made,<br>
consumed, wasted, and recycled. The latter implies the futile attempt to "make" virtuous<br>
actions into the products of "service" institutions. This leads to the identification of<br>
schooling and education, of medical service and health, of program-watching and<br>
entertainment, of speed and effective locomotion. This first option now goes under the<br>
name of development.<br>The radically alternative way to fill available time is a limited range of more durable<br>
goods and to provide access to institutions which can increase the opportunity and<br>
desirability of human interaction.<br>A durable-goods economy is precisely the contrary of an economy based on planned<br>
obsolescence. A durable-goods economy means a constraint on the bill of goods. Goods<br>
would have to be such that they provided the maximum opportunity to "do" something<br>
with them: items made for self-assembly, self-help, reuse, and repair.<br>The complement to a durable, repairable, and reusable bill of goods is not an increase of<br>
institutionally produced services, but rather an institutional framework which constantly<br>
educates to action, participation, and self-help. The movement of our society from the<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 45<br>present— in which all institutions gravitate toward post-industrial bureaucracy— to a future<br>
of postindustrial conviviality— in which the intensity of action would prevail over<br>
production— must begin with a renewal of style in the service institutions— and, first of all,<br>
with a renewal of education. A future which is desirable and feasible depends on our<br>
willingness to invest our technological know-how into the growth of convivial<br>
institutions. In the field of educational research, this amounts to the request for a reversal<br>
of present trends.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 46<br>5<br>Irrational Consistencies*<br>
<br>This chapter was presented originally at a meeting of the American Educational<br>
Research Association, in New York City, February 6, 1971.
<br>I believe that the contemporary crisis of education demands that we review the very idea<br>
of publicly prescribed learning, rather than the methods used in its enforcement. The<br>
dropout rate— especially of junior-high-school students and elementary- school teachers—<br>
points to a grass-roots demand for a completely fresh look. The "classroom practitioner"<br>
who considers himself a liberal teacher is increasingly attacked from all sides. The free-<br>
school movement, confusing discipline with indoctrination, has painted him into the role<br>
of a destructive authoritarian. The educational technologist consistently demonstrates the<br>
teacher's inferiority at measuring and modifying behavior. And the school administration<br>
for which he works forces him to bow to both Summerhill and Skinner, making it<br>
obvious that compulsory learning cannot be a liberal enterprise. No wonder that the<br>
desertion rate of teachers is overtaking that of their students.<br>America's commitment to the compulsory education of its young now reveals itself to be<br>
as futile as the pretended American commitment to compulsory democratization of the<br>
Vietnamese. Conventional schools obviously cannot do it. The free-school movement<br>
entices unconventional educators, but ultimately does so in support of the conventional<br>
ideology of schooling. And the promises of educational technologists, that their research<br>
and development— if adequately funded— can offer some kind of final solution to the<br>
resistance of youth to compulsory learning, sound as confident and prove as fatuous as<br>
the analogous promises made by the military technologists.<br>The criticism directed at the American school system by the behaviorists and that coming<br>
from the new breed of radical educators seem radically opposed. The behaviorists apply<br>
educational research to the "induction of autotelic instruction through individualized<br>
learning packages." Their style clashes with the nondirective cooption of youth into<br>
liberated communes established under the supervision of adults. Yet, in historical<br>
perspective, these two are just contemporary manifestations of the seemingly<br>
contradictory yet really complementary goals of the public school system. From the<br>
beginning of this century, the schools have been protagonists of social control on the one<br>
hand and free cooperation on the other, both placed at the service of the "good society,"<br>
conceived of as a highly organized and smoothly working corporate structure. Under the<br>
impact of intense urbanization, children became a natural resource to be molded by the<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 47<br>schools and fed into the industrial machine. Progressive politics and the cult of efficiency<br>
converged in the growth of the U.S. public school. Vocational guidance and the junior<br>
high school were two important results of this kind of thinking. [See Joel Spring,<br>
Education and the Rise of the Corporate State, Cuademo No. 50. Centro Intercultural de<br>
Documentacin, Cuernavaca, Mexico, 1971.]<br>It appears, therefore, that the attempt to produce specified behavioral changes which can<br>
be measured and for which the processor can be held accountable is just one side of a<br>
coin, whose other side is the pacification of the new generation within specially<br>
engineered enclaves which will seduce them into the dream world of their elders. These<br>
pacified in society are well described by Dewey, who wants us to "make each one of our<br>
schools an embryonic community life, active with types of occupations that reflect the<br>
life of the larger society, and permeate it with the spirit of art, history and science." In<br>
this historical perspective, it would be a grave mistake to interpret the current three-<br>
cornered controversy between the school establishment, the educational technologists and<br>
the free schools as the prelude to a revolution in education. This controversy reflects<br>
rather a stage of an attempt to escalate an old dream into fact, and to finally make all<br>
valuable learning the result of professional teaching. Most educational alternatives<br>
proposed converge toward goals which are immanent in the production of the cooperative<br>
man whose individual needs are met by means of his specialization in the American<br>
system: They are oriented toward the improvement of what-for lack of a better phrase— I<br>
call the schooled society. Even the seemingly radical critics of the school system are not<br>
willing to abandon the idea that they have an obligation to the young, especially to the<br>
poor, an obligation to process them, whether by love or by fear, into a society which<br>
needs disciplined specialization as much from its producers as from its consumers and<br>
also their full commitment to the ideology which puts economic growth first.<br>Dissent veils the contradictions inherent in the very idea of school. The established<br>
teachers unions, the technological wizards, and the educational liberation movement<br>
reinforce the commitment of the entire society to the fundamental axioms of a schooled<br>
world, somewhat in the manner in which many peace and protest movements reinforce<br>
the commitments of their members— be they black, female, young, or poor— to seek justice<br>
through the growth of the gross national income.<br>Some of the tenets which now go unchallenged are easy to list. There is, first, the shared<br>
belief that behavior which has been acquired in the sight of a pedagogue is of special<br>
value to the pupil and of special benefit to society. This is related to the assumption that<br>
social man is bom only in adolescence, and properly born only if he matures in the<br>
school-womb, which some want to gentle by permissiveness, others to stuff with gadgets,<br>
and still others to varnish with a liberal tradition. And there is, finally, a shared view of<br>
youth which is psychologically romantic and politically conservative. According to this<br>
view, changes in society must be brought about by burdening the young with the<br>
responsibility of transforming it-but only after their eventual release from school. It is<br>
easy for a society founded on such tenets to build up a sense of its responsibility for the<br>
education of the new generation, and this inevitably means that some men may set,<br>
specify, and evaluate the personal goals of others. In a "passage from an imaginary<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 48<br>Chinese encyclopedia," Jorge Luis Borges tries to evoke the sense of giddiness such an<br>
attempt must produce. He tells us that animals are divided into the following classes: "(a)<br>
those belonging to the emperor, (b) those that are embalmed, (c) those that are<br>
domesticated, (d) the suckling pigs, (e) the sirens, (f) fabulous ones, (g) the roaming<br>
dogs, (h) those included in the present classification, (i) those that drive themselves crazy,<br>
(]) innumerable ones, (k) those painted with a very fine brush of camel hair, (1) et cetera,<br>
(m) those who have just broken the jug, (n) those who resemble flies from afar." Now,<br>
such a taxonomy does not come into being unless somebody feels it can serve his<br>
purpose: in this case, I suppose, that somebody was a tax collector. For him, at least, this<br>
taxonomy of beasts must have made sense, the same way in which the taxonomy of<br>
educational objectives makes sense to scientific authors.<br>In the peasant, the vision of men with such inscrutable logic, empowered to assess his<br>
cattle, must have induced a chilling sense of impotence. Students, for analogous reasons,<br>
tend to feel paranoiac when they seriously submit to a curriculum. Inevitably they are<br>
even more frightened than my imaginary Chinese peasant, because it is their life goals<br>
rather than their life-stock which is being branded with an inscrutable sign.<br>This passage of Borges is fascinating, because it evokes the logic of irrational<br>
consistency which makes Kafka's and Koestler's bureaucracies so sinister yet so evocative<br>
of everyday life. Irrational consistency mesmerizes accomplices who are engaged in<br>
mutually expedient and disciplined exploitation. It is the logic generated by bureaucratic<br>
behavior. And it becomes the logic of a society which demands that the managers of its<br>
educational institutions be held publicly accountable for the behavioral modification they<br>
produce in their clients. Students who can be motivated to value the educational packages<br>
which their teachers obligate them to consume are comparable to Chinese peasants who<br>
can fit their flocks into the tax form provided by Borges.<br>At some time during the last two generations a commitment to therapy triumphed in<br>
American culture, and teachers came to be regarded as the therapists whose ministrations<br>
all men need, if they wish to enjoy the equality and freedom with which, according to the<br>
Constitution, they are born. Now the teacher-therapists go on to propose lifelong<br>
educational treatment as the next step. The style of this treatment is under discussion:<br>
Should it take the form of continued adult classroom attendance? Electronic ecstasy? Or<br>
periodic sensitivity sessions? All educators are ready to conspire to push out the walls of<br>
the classroom, with the goal of transforming the entire culture into a school.<br>The American controversy over the future of education, behind its rhetoric and noise, is<br>
more conservative than the discourse in other areas of public policy. On foreign affairs, at<br>
least, an organized minority constantly reminds us that the United States must renounce<br>
its role as the world's policeman. Radical economists, and now even their less radical<br>
teachers, question aggregate growth as a desirable goal. There are lobbies for prevention<br>
over cure in medicine and others in favor of fluidity over speed in transportation. Only in<br>
the field of education do the articulate voices demanding a radical deschooling of society<br>
remain so dispersed. There is a lack of cogent argument and of mature leadership aiming<br>
at the disestablishment of any and all institutions which serve the purpose of compulsory<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 49<br>learning. For the moment, the radical deschooling of society is still a cause without a<br>
party. This is especially surprising in a time of growing, though chaotic, resistance to all<br>
forms of institutionally planned instruction on the part of those aged twelve to seventeen.<br>Educational innovators still assume that educational institutions function like funnels for<br>
the programs they package. For my argument it is irrelevant whether these funnels take<br>
the form of a classroom, a TV transmitter, or a "liberated zone." It is equally irrelevant<br>
whether the packages purveyed are rich or poor, hot or cold, hard and measurable (like<br>
Math III), or impossible to assess (like sensitivity). What counts is that education is<br>
assumed to be the result of an institutional process managed by the educator. As long as<br>
the relations continue to be those between a supplier and a consumer, educational<br>
research will remain a circular process. It will amass scientific evidence in support of the<br>
need for more educational packages and for their more deadly accurate delivery to the<br>
individual customer, just as a certain brand of social science can prove the need for the<br>
delivery of more military treatment.<br>An educational revolution depends on a twofold inversion: a new orientation for research<br>
and a new understanding of the educational style of an emerging counterculture.<br>Operational research now seeks to optimize the efficiency of an inherited framework— a<br>
framework which is itself never questioned. This framework has the syntactic structure of<br>
a funnel for teaching packages. The syntactic alternative to it is an educational network or<br>
web for the autonomous assembly of resources under the personal control of each learner.<br>
This alternative structure of an educational institution now lies within the conceptual<br>
blind spot of our operational research. If research were to focus on it, this would<br>
constitute a true scientific revolution.<br>The blind spot of educational research reflects the cultural bias of a society in which<br>
technological growth has been confused with technocratic control. For the technocrat the<br>
value of an environment increases as more contacts between each man and his milieu can<br>
be programmed. In this world the choices which are manageable for the observer or<br>
planner converge with the choices possible for the observed so-called beneficiary.<br>
Freedom is reduced to a selection among packaged commodities.<br>The emerging counterculture reaffirms the values of semantic content above the<br>
efficiency of increased and more rigid syntax. It values the wealth of connotation above<br>
the power of syntax to produce wealth. It values the unpredictable outcome of self-chosen<br>
personal encounter above the certified quality of professional instruction. This<br>
reorientation toward personal surprise rather than institutionally engineered values will be<br>
disruptive of the established order until we dissociate the increasing availability of<br>
technological tools which facilitate encounter from the increasing control of the<br>
technocrat of what happens when people meet.<br>Our present educational institutions are at the service of the teacher's goals. The relational<br>
structures we need are those which will enable each man to define himself by learning<br>
and by contributing to the learning of others.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 50<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page #51<br>6<br>Learning Webs<br>In a previous chapter I discussed what is becoming a common complaint about schools,<br>
one that is reflected, for example, in the recent report of the Carnegie Commission: In<br>
school registered students submit to certified teachers in order to obtain certificates of<br>
their own; both are frustrated and both blame insufficient resources— money, time, or<br>
buildings— for their mutual frustration.<br>Such criticism leads many people to ask whether it is possible to conceive of a different<br>
style of learning. The same people, paradoxically, when pressed to specify how they<br>
acquired what they know and value, will readily admit that they learned it more often<br>
outside than inside school. Their knowledge of facts, their understanding of life and work<br>
came to them from friendship or love, while viewing TV, or while reading, from<br>
examples of peers or the challenge of a street encounter. Or they may have learned what<br>
they know through the apprenticeship ritual for admission to a street gang or the initiation<br>
to a hospital, newspaper city room, plumber's shop, or insurance office. The alternative to<br>
dependence on schools is not the use of public resources for some new device which<br>
"makes" people learn; rather it is the creation of a new style of educational relationship<br>
between man and his environment. To foster this style, attitudes toward growing up, the<br>
tools available for learning, and the quality and structure of daily life will have to change<br>
concurrently.<br>Attitudes are already changing. The proud dependence on school is gone. Consumer<br>
resistance increases in the knowledge industry. Many teachers and pupils, taxpayers and<br>
employers, economists and policemen would prefer not to depend any longer on schools.<br>
What prevents their frustration from shaping new institutions is a lack not only of<br>
imagination but frequently also of appropriate language and of enlightened self-interest.<br>
They cannot visualize either a deschooled society or educational institutions in a society<br>
which has disestablished school.<br>In this chapter I intend to show that the inverse of school is possible: that we can depend<br>
on self-motivated learning instead of employing teachers to bribe or compel the student<br>
to find the time and the will to learn; that we can provide the learner with new links to the<br>
world instead of continuing to funnel all educational programs through the teacher. I shall<br>
discuss some of the general characteristics which distinguish schooling from learning and<br>
outline four major categories of educational institutions which should appeal not only to<br>
many individuals but also to many existing interest groups.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 52<br>An Objection: Who Can Be Served by Bridges to Nowhere?<br>We are used to considering schools as a variable, dependent on the political and<br>
economic structure. If we can change the style of political leadership, or promote the<br>
interests of one class or another, or switch from private to public ownership of the means<br>
of production, we assume the school system will change as well. The educational<br>
institutions I will propose, however, are meant to serve a society which does not now<br>
exist, although the current frustration with schools is itself potentially a major force to set<br>
in motion change toward new social arrangements. An obvious objection has been raised<br>
to this approach: Why channel energy to build bridges to nowhere, instead of marshaling<br>
it first to change not the schools but the political and economic system?<br>This objection, however, underestimates the fundamental political and economic nature<br>
of the school system itself, as well as the political potential inherent in any effective<br>
challenge to it. In a basic sense, schools have ceased to be dependent on the ideology<br>
professed by any government or market organization. Other basic institutions might differ<br>
from one country to another: family, party, church, or press. But everywhere the school<br>
system has the same structure, and everywhere its hidden curriculum has the same effect.<br>
Invariably, it shapes the consumer who values institutional commodities above the<br>
nonprofessional ministration of a neighbor.<br>Everywhere the hidden curriculum of schooling initiates the citizen to the myth that<br>
bureaucracies guided by scientific knowledge are efficient and benevolent. Everywhere<br>
this same curriculum instills in the pupil the myth that increased production will""<br>
provide a better life. And everywhere it develops the habit of self-defeating consumption<br>
of services and alienating production, the tolerance for institutional dependence, and the<br>
recognition of institutional rankings. The hidden curriculum of school does all this in<br>
spite of contrary efforts undertaken by teachers and no matter what ideology prevails.<br>In other words, schools are fundamentally alike in all countries, be they fascist,<br>
democratic or socialist, big or small, rich or poor. This identity of the school system<br>
forces us to recognize the profound world-wide identity of myth, mode of production,<br>
and method of social control, despite the great variety of mythologies in which the myth<br>
finds expression.<br>In view of this identity, it is illusory to claim that schools are, in any profound sense,<br>
dependent variables. This means that to hope for fundamental change in the school<br>
system as an effect of conventionally conceived social or economic change is also an<br>
illusion. Moreover, this illusion grants the school— the reproductive organ of a consumer<br>
society-almost unquestioned immunity.<br>It is at this point that the example of China becomes important. For three millennia,<br>China protected higher learning through a total divorce between the process of learning<br>
and the privilege conferred by mandarin examinations. To become a world power and a<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 53<br>modern nation-state, China had to adopt the international style of schooling. Only<br>
hindsight will allow us to discover if the Great Cultural Revolution will turn out to have<br>
been the first successful attempt at deschooling the institutions of society.<br>Even the piecemeal creation of new educational agencies which were the inverse of<br>
school would be an attack on the most sensitive link of a pervasive phenomenon, which is<br>
organized by the state in all countries. A political program which does not explicitly<br>
recognize the need for deschooling is not revolutionary; it is demagoguery calling for<br>
more of the same. Any major political program of the seventies should be evaluated by<br>
this measure: How clearly does it state the need for deschooling— and how clearly does it<br>
provide guidelines for the educational quality of the society for which it aims?<br>The struggle against domination by the world market and big-power politics might be<br>
beyond some poor communities or countries, but this weakness is an added reason for<br>
emphasizing the importance of liberating each society through a reversal of its<br>
educational structure, a change which is not beyond any society's means.<br>General Characteristics of New Formal Educational Institutions<br>A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all who want to<br>
learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want<br>
to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally,<br>
furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their<br>
challenge known. Such a system would require the application of constitutional<br>
guarantees to education. Learners should not be forced to submit to an obligatory<br>
curriculum, or to discrimination based on whether they possess a certificate or a diploma.<br>
Nor should the public be forced to support, through a regressive taxation, a huge<br>
professional apparatus of educators and buildings which in fact restricts the public's<br>
chances for learning to the services the profession is willing to put on the market. It<br>
should use modern technology to make free speech, free assembly, and a free press truly<br>
universal and, therefore, fully educational.<br>Schools are designed on the assumption that there is a secret to everything in life; that the<br>
quality of life depends on knowing that secret; that secrets can be known only in orderly<br>
successions; and that only teachers can properly reveal these secrets. An individual with a<br>
schooled mind conceives of the world as a pyramid of classified packages accessible only<br>
to those who carry the proper tags. New educational institutions would break apart this<br>
pyramid. Their purpose must be to facilitate access for the learner: to allow him to look<br>
into the windows of the control room or the parliament, if he cannot get in by the door.<br>
Moreover, such new institutions should be channels to which the learner would have<br>
access without credentials or pedigree-public spaces in which peers and elders outside<br>
his immediate horizon would become available.<br>I believe that no more than four— possibly even three— distinct "channels" or learning<br>
exchanges could contain all the resources needed for real learning. The child grows up in<br>
a world of things, surrounded by people who serve as models for skills and values. He<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 54<br>finds peers who challenge him to argue, to compete, to cooperate, and to understand; and<br>
if the child is lucky, he is exposed to confrontation or criticism by an experienced elder<br>
who really cares. Things, models, peers, and elders are four resources each of which<br>
requires a different type of arrangement to ensure that everybody has ample access to it.<br>I will use the words "opportunity web" for "network" to designate specific ways to<br>
provide access to each of four sets of resources. "Network" is often used, unfortunately,<br>
to designate the channels reserved to material selected by others for indoctrination,<br>
instruction, and entertainment. But it can also be used for the telephone or the postal<br>
service, which are primarily accessible to individuals who want to send messages to one<br>
another. I wish we had another word to designate such reticular structures for mutual<br>
access, a word less evocative of entrapment, less degraded by current usage and more<br>
suggestive of the fact that any such arrangement includes legal, organizational, and<br>
technical aspects. Not having found such a term, I will try to redeem the one which is<br>
available, using it as a synonym of "educational web."<br>What are needed are new networks, readily available to the public and designed to spread<br>
equal opportunity for learning and teaching.<br>To give an example: The same level of technology is used in TV and in tape recorders.<br>
All Latin- American countries now have introduced TV: in Bolivia the government has<br>
financed a TV station, which was built six years ago, and there are no more than seven<br>
thousand TV sets for four million citizens. The money now tied up in TV installations<br>
throughout Latin America could have provided every fifth adult with a tape recorder. In<br>
addition, the money would have sufficed to provide an almost unlimited library of<br>
prerecorded tapes, with outlets even in remote villages, as well as an ample supply of<br>
empty tapes.<br>This network of tape recorders, of course, would be radically different from the present<br>
network of TV. It would provide opportunity for free expression: literate and illiterate<br>
alike could record, preserve, disseminate, and repeat their opinions. The present<br>
investment in TV, instead, provides bureaucrats, whether politicians or educators, with<br>
the power to sprinkle the continent with institutionally produced programs which they-or<br>
their sponsors— decide are good for or in demand by the people.<br>Technology is available to develop either independence and learning or bureaucracy and<br>
teaching.<br>Four Networks<br>The planning of new educational institutions ought not to begin with the administrative<br>
goals of a principal or president, or with the teaching goals of a professional educator, or<br>
with the learning goals of any hypothetical class of people. It must not start with the<br>
question, "What should someone learn?" but with the question, "What kinds of things and<br>
people might learners want to be in contact with in order to learn?"<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 55<br>Someone who wants to learn knows that he needs both information and critical response<br>
to its use from somebody else. Information can be stored in things and in persons. In a<br>
good educational system access to things ought to be available at the sole bidding of the<br>
learner, while access to informants requires, in addition, others' consent. Criticism can<br>
also come from two directions: from peers or from elders, that is, from fellow learners<br>
whose immediate interests match mine, or from those who will grant me a share in their<br>
superior experience. Peers can be colleagues with whom to raise a question, companions<br>
for playful and enjoyable (or arduous) reading or walking, challengers at any type of<br>
game. Elders can be consultants on which skill to learn, which method to use, what<br>
company to seek at a given moment. They can be guides to the right questions to be<br>
raised among peers and to the deficiency of the answers they arrive at. Most of these<br>
resources are plentiful. But they are neither conventionally perceived as educational<br>
resources, nor is access to them for learning purposes easy, especially for the poor. We<br>
must conceive of new relational structures which are deliberately set up to facilitate<br>
access to these resources for the use of anybody who is motivated to seek them for his<br>
education. Administrative, technological, and especially legal arrangements are required<br>
to set up such web-like structures.<br>Educational resources are usually labeled according to educators' curricular goals. I<br>
propose to do the contrary, to label four different approaches which enable the student to<br>
gain access to any educational resource which may help him to define and achieve his<br>
own goals:<br>
<br>
Reference Services to Educational Objects-which facilitate access to things or<br>
processes used for formal learning. Some of these things can be reserved for this purpose,<br>
stored in libraries, rental agencies, laboratories, and showrooms like museums and<br>
theaters; others can be in daily use in factories, airports, or on farms, but made available<br>
to students as apprentices or on off hours.

<br>
Skill Exchanges— which permit persons to list their skills, the conditions under which<br>
they are willing to serve as models for others who want to learn these skills, and the<br>
addresses at which they can be reached.

<br>
Peer-Matching— a communications network which permits persons to describe the<br>
learning activity in which they wish to engage, in the hope of finding a partner for the<br>
inquiry.

<br>
Reference Services to Educators-at-Large— who can be listed in a directory giving the<br>
addresses and self-descriptions of professionals, paraprofessionals, and free-lancers,<br>
along with conditions of access to their services. Such educators, as we will see, could be<br>
chosen by polling or consulting their former clients.

<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 56<br>Reference Services to Educational Objects<br>Things are basic resources for learning. The quality of the environment and the<br>
relationship of a person to it will determine how much he learns incidentally. Formal<br>
learning requires special access to ordinary things, on the one hand, or, on the other, easy<br>
and dependable access to special things made for educational purposes. An example of<br>
the former is the special right to operate or dismantle a machine in a garage. An example<br>
of the latter is the general right to use an abacus, a computer, a book, a botanical garden,<br>
or a machine withdrawn from production and placed at the full disposal of students.<br>At present, attention is focused on the disparity between rich and poor children in their<br>
access to things and in the manner in which they can learn from them. OEO and other<br>
agencies, following this approach, concentrate on equalizing chances, by trying to<br>
provide more educational equipment for the poor. A more radical point of departure<br>
would be to recognize that in the city rich and poor alike are artificially kept away from<br>
most of the things that surround them. Children bom into the age of plastics and<br>
efficiency experts must penetrate two barriers which obstruct their understanding: one<br>
built into things and the other around institutions. Industrial design creates a world of<br>
things that resist insight into their nature, and schools shut the learner out of the world of<br>
things in their meaningful setting.<br>After a short visit to New York, a woman from a Mexican village told me she was<br>
impressed by the fact that stores sold only wares heavily made up with cosmetics." I<br>
understood her to mean that industrial products "speak" to their customers about their<br>
allurements and not about their nature. Industry has surrounded people with artifacts<br>
whose inner workings only specialists are allowed to understand. The nonspecialist is<br>
discouraged from figuring out what makes a watch tick, or a tele-phone ring, or an<br>
electric typewriter work, by being warned that it will break if he tries. He can be told<br>
what makes a transistor radio work, but he cannot find out for himself. This type of<br>
design tends to reinforce a noninventive society in which the experts find it progressively<br>
easier to hide behind their expertise and beyond evaluation.<br>The man-made environment has become as inscrutable as nature is for the primitive. At<br>
the same time, educational materials have been monopolized by school. Simple<br>
educational objects have been expensively packaged by the knowledge industry. They<br>
have become specialized tools for professional educators, and their cost has been inflated<br>
by forcing them to stimulate either environments or teachers.<br>The teacher is jealous of the textbook he defines as his professional implement. The<br>
student may come to hate the lab because he associates it with schoolwork. The<br>
administrator rationalizes his protective attitude toward the library as a defense of costly<br>
public equipment against those who would play with it rather than learn. In this<br>
atmosphere the student too often uses the map, the lab, the encyclopedia, or the<br>
microscope only at the rare moments when the curriculum tells him to do so. Even the<br>
great classics become part of "sophomore year" instead of marking a new turn in a<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 57<br>person's life. School removes things from everyday use by labeling them educational<br>
tools.<br>If we are to deschool, both tendencies must be reversed. The general physical<br>
environment must be made accessible, and those physical learning resources which have<br>
been reduced to teaching instruments must become generally available for self-directed<br>
learning. Using things only as part of a curriculum can have an even worse effect than<br>
just removing them from the general environment. It can corrupt the attitudes of pupils.<br>Games are a case in point. I do not mean the "games" of the physical education<br>
department (such as football and basketball), which the schools use to raise income and<br>
prestige and in which they have made a substantial capital investment. As the athletes<br>
themselves are well aware, these enterprises, which take the form of warlike tournaments,<br>
have undermined the playfulness of sports and are used to reinforce the competitive<br>
nature of schools. Rather I have in mind the educational games which can provide a<br>
unique way to penetrate formal systems. Set theory, linguistics, propositional logic,<br>
geometry, physics, and even chemistry reveal themselves with little effort to certain<br>
persons who play these games. A friend of mine went to a Mexican market with a game<br>
called '"Wff 'n Proof," which consists of some dice on which twelve logical symbols are<br>
imprinted. He showed children which two or three combinations constituted a well-<br>
formed sentence, and inductively within the first hour some onlookers also grasped the<br>
principle. Within a few hours of playfully conducting formal logical proofs, some<br>
children are capable of introducing others to the fundamental proofs of propositional<br>
logic. The others just walk away.<br>In fact, for some children such games are a special form of liberating education, since<br>
they heighten their awareness of the fact that formal systems are built on changeable<br>
axioms and that conceptual operations have a gamelike nature. They are also simple,<br>
cheap, and-to a large extent-can be organized by the players themselves. Used outside<br>
the curriculum such games provide an opportunity for identifying and developing unusual<br>
talent, while the school psychologist will often identify those who have such talent as in<br>
danger of becoming antisocial, sick, or unbalanced. Within school, when used in the form<br>
of tournaments, games are not only removed from the sphere of leisure; they often<br>
become tools used to translate playfulness into competition, a lack of abstract reasoning<br>
into a sign of inferiority. An exercise which is liberating for some character types<br>
becomes a straitjacket for others.<br>The control of school over educational equipment has still another effect. It increases<br>
enormously the cost of such cheap materials. Once their use is restricted to scheduled<br>
hours, professionals are paid to supervise their acquisition, storage, and use. Then<br>
students vent their anger against the school on the equipment, which must be purchased<br>
once again.<br>Paralleling the untouchability of teaching tools is the impenetrability of modern junk. In<br>
the thirties any self-respecting boy knew how to repair an automobile, but now car<br>
makers multiply wires and withhold manuals from everyone except specialized<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 58<br>mechanics. In a former era an old radio contained enough coils and condensers to build a<br>
transmitter that would make all the neighborhood radios scream in feedback. Transistor<br>
radios are more portable, but nobody dares to take them apart. To change this in the<br>
highly industrialized countries will be immensely difficult; but at least in the Third World<br>
we must insist on built-in educational qualities.<br>To illustrate my point, let me present a model: By spending ten million dollars it would<br>
be possible to connect forty thousand hamlets in a country like Peru with a spiderweb of<br>
six-foot-wide trails and maintain these, and, in addition, provide the country with 200,000<br>
three-wheeled mechanical donkeys— five on the average for each hamlet. Few poor<br>
countries of this size spend less than this yearly on cars and roads, both of which are now<br>
restricted mainly to the rich and their employees, while poor people remain trapped in<br>
their villages. Each of these simple but durable little vehicles would cost $125— half of<br>
which would pay for transmission and a six-horsepower motor. A "donkey" could make<br>
15 mph, and it can carry loads of 850 pounds (that is, most things besides tree trunks and<br>
steel beams which are ordinarily moved).<br>The political appeal of such a transportation system to a peasantry is obvious. Equally<br>
obvious is the reason why those who hold power— and thereby automatically have a car-<br>
are not interested in spending money on trails and in clogging roads with engine-driven<br>
donkeys. The universal donkey could work only if a country's leaders were willing to<br>
impose a national speed limit of, say, twenty-five miles an hour and adapt its public<br>
institutions to this. The model could not work if conceived only as a stopgap.<br>This is not the place to elaborate on the political, social, economic, financial, and<br>
technical feasibility of this model. I wish only to indicate that educational considerations<br>
may be of prime importance when choosing such an alternative to capital, intensive<br>
transport. By raising the unit cost per donkey by some 20 percent it would become<br>
possible to plan the production of all its parts in such a manner that, as far as possible,<br>
each future owner would spend a month or two making and understanding his machine<br>
and would be able to repair it. With this additional cost it would also be possible to<br>
decentralize production into dispersed plants. The added benefits would result not only<br>
from including educational costs in the construction process. Even more significantly, a<br>
durable motor which practically anyone could leam to repair and which could be used as<br>
a plow and pump by somebody who understood it would provide much higher<br>
educational benefits than the inscrutable engines of the advanced countries.<br>Not only the junk but also the supposedly public places of the modern city have become<br>
impenetrable. In American society, children are excluded from most things and places on<br>
the grounds that they are private. But even in societies which have declared an end to<br>
private property children are kept away from the same places and things because they are<br>
considered the special domain of professionals and dangerous to the uninitiated. Since the<br>
last generation the railroad yard has become as inaccessible as the fire station. Yet with a<br>
little ingenuity it should not be difficult to provide for safety in such places. To deschool<br>
the artifacts of education will require making the artifacts and processes available— and<br>
recognizing their educational value. Certainly, some workers would find it inconvenient<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 59<br>to be accessible to learners; but this inconvenience must be balanced against the<br>
educational gains.<br>Private cars could be banned from Manhattan. Five years ago it was unthinkable. Now<br>
certain New York streets are closed off at odd hours, and this trend will probably<br>
continue. Indeed, most cross-streets should be closed to automotive traffic and parking<br>
should be forbidden everywhere. In a city opened up to people, teaching materials which<br>
are now locked up in store-rooms and laboratories could be dispersed into independently<br>
operated storefront depots which children and adults could visit without the danger of<br>
being run over.<br>If the goals of learning were no longer dominated by schools and schoolteachers, the<br>
market for learners would be much more various and the definition of "educational<br>
artifacts" would be less restrictive. There could be tool shops, libraries, laboratories, and<br>
gaming rooms. Photo labs and offset presses would allow neighborhood newspapers to<br>
flourish. Some storefront learning centers could contain viewing booths for closed-circuit<br>
television, others could feature office equipment for use and for repair. The jukebox or<br>
the record player would be commonplace, with some specializing in classical music,<br>
others in international folk tunes, others in jazz. Film clubs would compete with each<br>
other and with commercial television. Museum outlets could be networks for circulating<br>
exhibits of works of art, both old and new, originals and reproductions, perhaps<br>
administered by the various metropolitan museums.<br>The professional personnel needed for this network would be much more like custodians,<br>
museum guides, or reference librarians than like teachers. From the comer biology store,<br>
they could refer their clients to the shell collection in the museum or indicate the next<br>
showing of biology videotapes in a certain viewing booth. They could furnish guides for<br>
pest control, diet, and other kinds of preventive medicine. They could refer those who<br>
needed advice to "elders" who could provide it.<br>Two distinct approaches can be taken to financing a network of "learning objects." A<br>
community could determine a maximum budget for this purpose and arrange for all parts<br>
of the network to be open to all visitors at reasonable hours. Or the community could<br>
decide to provide citizens with limited entitlements, according to their age group, which<br>
would give them special access to certain materials which are both costly and scarce,<br>
while leaving other, simpler materials available to everyone.<br>Finding resources for materials made specifically for education is only one— and perhaps<br>
the least costly— aspect of building an educational world. The money now spent on the<br>
sacred paraphernalia of the school ritual could be freed to provide all citizens with greater<br>
access to the real life of the city. Special tax incentives could be granted to those who<br>
employed children between the ages of eight and fourteen for a couple of hours each day<br>
if the conditions of employment were humane ones. We should return to the tradition of<br>
the bar mitzvah or confirmation. By this I mean we should first restrict, and later<br>
eliminate, the disenfranchisement of the young and permit a boy of twelve to become a<br>
man fully responsible for his participation in the life of the community. Many "school-<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 60<br>age" people know more about their neighborhood than social workers or councilmen. Of<br>
course, they also ask more embarrassing questions and propose solutions which threaten<br>
the bureaucracy. They should be allowed to come of age so that they could put their<br>
knowledge and fact-finding ability to work in the service of a popular government.<br>Until recently the dangers of school were easily underestimated in comparison with the<br>
dangers of an apprenticeship in the police force, the fire department, or the entertainment<br>
industry. It was easy to justify schools at least as a means to protect youth. Often this<br>
argument no longer holds. I recently visited a Methodist church in Harlem occupied by a<br>
group of armed Young Lords in protest against the death of Julio Rodan, a Puerto Rican<br>
youth found hanged in his prison cell. I knew the leaders of the group, who had spent a<br>
semester in Cuernavaca. When I wondered why one of them, Juan, was not among them,<br>I was told that he had "gone back on heroin and to the State University."<br>Planning, incentives, and legislation can be used to unlock the educational potential<br>
within our society's huge investment in plants and equipment. Full access to educational<br>
objects will not exist so long as business firms are allowed to combine the legal<br>
protections which the Bill of Rights reserves to the privacy of individuals with the<br>
economic power conferred upon them by their millions of customers and thousands of<br>
employees, stockholders, and suppliers. Much of the world's know-how and most of its<br>
productive processes and equipment are locked within the walls of business firms, away<br>
from their customers, employees, and stockholders, as well as from the general public,<br>
whose laws and facilities allow them to function. Money now spent on advertising in<br>
capitalist countries could be redirected toward education in and by General Electric,<br>
NBC-TV, or Budweiser beer. That is, the plants and offices should be reorganized so that<br>
their daily operations could be more accessible to the public in ways that would make<br>
learning possible; and, indeed, ways might be found to pay the companies for the learning<br>
people acquired from them.<br>An even more valuable body of scientific objects and data may be withheld from general<br>
access— and even from qualified scientists— under the guise of national security. Until<br>
recently science was the one forum which functioned like an anarchist's dream. Each man<br>
capable of doing research had more or less the same opportunity of access to its tools and<br>
to a hearing by the community of peers. Now bureaucratization and organization have<br>
placed much of science beyond public reach. Indeed, what used to be an international<br>
network of scientific information has been splintered into an arena of competing teams.<br>
The members as well as the artifacts of the scientific community have been locked into<br>
national and corporate programs oriented toward practical achievement, to the radical<br>
impoverishment of the men who support these nations and corporations.<br>In a world which is controlled and owned by nations and corporations, only limited<br>
access to educational objects will ever be possible. But increased access to those objects<br>
which can be shared for educational purposes may enlighten us enough to help us to<br>
break through these ultimate political barriers. Public schools transfer control over the<br>
educational uses of objects from private to professional hands. The institutional inversion<br>
of schools could empower the individual to reclaim the right to use them for education. A<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 61<br>truly public kind of ownership might begin to emerge if private or corporate control over<br>
the educational aspect of "things" were brought to the vanishing point.<br>Skill Exchanges<br>A guitar teacher, unlike a guitar, can be neither classified in a museum nor owned by the<br>
public nor rented from an educational warehouse. Teachers of skills belong to a different<br>
class of resources from objects needed to learn a skill. This is not to say that they are<br>
indispensable in every case. I can rent not only a guitar but also taped guitar lessons and<br>
illustrated chord charts, and with these things I can teach myself to play the guitar.<br>Indeed, this arrangement may have advantages-if the available tapes are better than the<br>
available teachers, or if the only time I have for learning the guitar is late at night, or if<br>
the tunes I wish to play are unknown in my country, or if I am shy and prefer to fumble<br>
along in privacy.<br>Skill teachers must be listed and contacted through a different kind of channel from that<br>
of things. A thing is available at the bidding of the user— or could be— whereas a person<br>
formally becomes a skill resource only when he consents to do so, and he can also restrict<br>
time, place, and method as he chooses.<br>Skill teachers must be also distinguished from peers from whom one would learn. Peers<br>
who wish to pursue a common inquiry must start from common interests and abilities;<br>
they get together to exercise or improve a skill they share: basketball, dancing,<br>
constructing a camp site, or discussing the next election. The first transmission of a skill,<br>
on the other hand, involves bringing together someone who has the skill and someone<br>
who does not have it and wants to acquire it.<br>A "skill model" is a person who possesses a skill and is willing to demonstrate its<br>
practice. A demonstration of this kind is frequently a necessary resource for a potential<br>
learner. Modern inventions permit us to incorporate demonstration into tape, film, or<br>
chart; yet one would hope personal demonstration will remain in wide demand, especially<br>
in communication skills. Some ten thousand adults have learned Spanish at our Center at<br>
Cuernavaca— mostly highly motivated persons who wanted to acquire near-native fluency<br>
in a second language. When they are faced with a choice between carefully programmed<br>
instruction in a lab or drill sessions with two other students and a native speaker<br>
following a rigid routine, most choose the second.<br>For most widely shared skills, a person who demonstrates the skill is the only human<br>
resource we ever need or get. Whether in speaking or driving, in cooking or in the use of<br>
communication equipment, we are often barely conscious of formal instruction and<br>
learning, especially after our first experience of the materials in question. I see no reason<br>
why other complex skills, such as the mechanical aspects of surgery and playing the<br>
fiddle, of reading or the use of directories and catalogues, could not be learned in the<br>
same way.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 62<br>A well-motivated student who does not labor under a specific handicap often needs no<br>
further human assistance than can be provided by someone who can demonstrate on<br>
demand how to do what the learner wants to learn to do. The demand made of skilled<br>
people that before demonstrating their skill they be certified as pedagogues is a result of<br>
the insistence either that people learn what they do not want to know or that all people-<br>
even those with a special handicap— learn certain things, at a given moment in their lives,<br>
and preferably under specified circumstances.<br>What makes skills scarce on the present educational market is the institutional<br>
requirement that those who can demonstrate them may not do so unless they are given<br>
public trust, through a certificate. We insist that those who help others acquire a skill<br>
should also know how to diagnose learning difficulties and be able to motivate people to<br>
aspire to learn skills. In short, we demand that they be pedagogues. People who can<br>
demonstrate skills will be plentiful as soon as we learn to recognize them outside the<br>
teaching profession.<br>Where princelings are being taught, the parents' insistence that the teacher and the person<br>
with skills be combined in one person is understandable, if no longer defensible. But for<br>
all parents to aspire to have Aristotle for their Alexander is obviously self-defeating. The<br>
person who can both inspire students and demonstrate a technique is so rare, and so hard<br>
to recognize, that even princelings more often get a sophist than a true philosopher.<br>A demand for scarce skills can be quickly filled even if there are only small numbers of<br>
people to demonstrate them; but such people must be easily available. During the forties<br>
radio repairmen, most of them with no schooling in their work, were no more than two<br>
years behind radios in penetrating the interior of Latin America. There they stayed until<br>
transistor radios, which are cheap to purchase and impossible to repair, put them out of<br>
business. Technical schools now fail to accomplish what repair, men of equally useful,<br>
more durable radios could do as a matter of course.<br>Converging self-interests now conspire to stop a man from sharing his skill. The man<br>
who has the skill profits from its scarcity and not from its reproduction. The teacher who<br>
special, izes in transmitting the skill profits from the artisan's unwillingness to launch his<br>
own apprentice into the field. The public is indoctrinated to believe that skills are<br>
valuable and reliable only if they are the result of formal schooling. The job market<br>
depends on making skills scarce and on keeping them scarce, either by proscribing their<br>
unauthorized use and transmission or by making things which can be operated and<br>
repaired only by those who have access to tools or information which are kept scarce.<br>Schools thus produce shortages of skilled persons. A good example is the diminishing<br>
number of nurses in the United States, owing to the rapid increase of four-year B.S.<br>
programs in nursing. Women from poorer families, who would formerly have enrolled in<br>
a two- or three-year program, now stay out of the nursing profession altogether.<br>Insisting on the certification of teachers is another way of keeping skills scarce. If nurses<br>
were encouraged to train nurses, and if nurses were employed on the basis of their proven<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 63<br>skill at giving injections, filling out charts, and giving medicine, there would soon be no<br>
lack of trained nurses. Certification now tends to abridge the freedom of education by<br>
converting the civil right to share one's knowledge into the privilege of academic<br>
freedom, now conferred only on the employees of a school. To guarantee access to an<br>
effective exchange of skills, we need legislation which generalizes academic freedom.<br>
The right to teach any skill should come under the protection of freedom of speech. Once<br>
restrictions on teaching are removed, they will quickly be removed from learning as well.<br>The teacher of skills needs some inducement to grant his services to a pupil. There are at<br>
least two simple ways to begin to channel public funds to noncertified teachers. One way<br>
would be to institutionalize the skill exchange by creating free skill centers open to the<br>
public. Such centers could and should be established in industrialized areas, at least for<br>
those skills which are fundamental prerequisites for entering certain apprenticeships—<br>
such skills as reading, typing, keeping accounts, foreign languages, computer<br>
programming and number manipulation, reading special languages such as that of<br>
electrical circuits, manipulation of certain machinery, etc. Another approach would be to<br>
give certain groups within the population educational currency good for attendance at<br>
skill centers where other clients would have to pay commercial rates.<br>A much more radical approach would be to create a "bank" for skill exchange. Each<br>
citizen would be given a basic credit with which to acquire fundamental skills. Beyond<br>
that minimum, further credits would go to those who earned them by teaching, whether<br>
they served as models in organized skill centers or did so privately at home or on the<br>
playground. Only those who had taught others for an equivalent amount of time would<br>
have a claim on the time of more advanced teachers. An entirely new elite would be<br>
promoted, an elite of those who earned their education by sharing it.<br>Should parents have the right to earn skill credit for their children? Since such an<br>
arrangement would give further advantage to the privileged classes, it might be offset by<br>
granting a larger credit to the underprivileged. The operation of a skill exchange would<br>
depend on the existence of agencies which would facilitate the development of directory<br>
information and assure its free and inexpensive use. Such an agency might also provide<br>
supplementary services of testing and certification and might help to enforce the<br>
legislation required to break up and prevent monopolistic practices.<br>Fundamentally, the freedom of a universal skill exchange must be guaranteed by laws<br>
which permit discrimination only on the basis of tested skills and not on the basis of<br>
educational pedigree. Such a guarantee inevitably requires public control over tests which<br>
may be used to qualify persons for the job market. Otherwise, it would be possible to<br>
surreptitiously reintroduce complex batteries of tests at the work place itself which would<br>
serve for social selection. Much could be done to make skill-testing objective, e.g.,<br>
allowing only the operation of specific machines or systems to be tested. Tests of typing<br>
(measured according to speed, number of errors, and whether or not the typist can work<br>
from dictation), operation of an accounting system or of a hydraulic crane, driving,<br>
coding into COBOL, etc., can easily be made objective.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 64<br>In fact, many of the true skills which are of practical importance can be so tested. And for<br>
the purposes of manpower management a test of a current skill level is much more useful<br>
than the information that twenty years ago a person satisfied his teacher in a curriculum<br>
in which typing, stenography, and accounting were taught. The very need for official<br>
skill-testing can, of course, be questioned: I personally believe that freedom from undue<br>
hurt to a man's reputation through labeling is better guaranteed by restricting than by<br>
forbidding tests of competence.<br>Peer-Matching<br>At their worst, schools gather classmates into the same room and subject them to the<br>
same sequence of treatment in math, citizenship, and spelling. At their best, they permit<br>
each student to choose one of a limited number of courses. In any case, groups of peers<br>
form around the goals of teachers. A desirable educational system would let each person<br>
specify the activity for which he sought a peer.<br>School does offer children an opportunity to escape their homes and meet new friends.<br>
But, at the same time, this process indoctrinates children with the idea that they should<br>
select their friends from among those with whom they are put together. Providing the<br>
young from their earliest age with invitations to meet, evaluate, and seek out others<br>
would prepare them for a lifelong interest in seeking new partners for new endeavors.<br>A good chess player is always glad to find a close match, and one novice to find another.<br>
Clubs serve their purpose. People who want to discuss specific books or articles would<br>
probably pay to find discussion partners. People who want to play games, go on<br>
excursions, build fish tanks, or motorize bicycles will go to considerable lengths to find<br>
peers. The reward for their efforts is finding those peers. Good schools try to bring out<br>
the common interests of their students registered in the same program. The inverse of<br>
school would be an institution which increased the chances that persons who at a given<br>
moment shared the same specific interest could meet— no matter what else they had in<br>
common.<br>Skill-teaching does not provide equal benefits for both parties, as does the matching of<br>
peers. The teacher of skills, as I have pointed out, must usually be offered some incentive<br>
beyond the rewards of teaching. Skill-teaching is a matter of repeating drills over and<br>
over and is, in fact, all the more dreary for those pupils who need it most. A skill<br>
exchange needs currency or credits or other tangible incentives in order to operate, even<br>
if the exchange itself were to generate a currency of its own. A peer-match, ing system<br>
requires no such incentives, but only a communications network.<br>Tapes, retrieval systems, programmed instruction, and reproduction of shapes and sounds<br>
tend to reduce the need for recourse to human teachers of many skills; they increase the<br>
efficiency of teachers and the number of skills one can pick up in a lifetime. Parallel to<br>
this runs an increased need to meet people interested in enjoying the newly acquired skill.<br>
A student who has picked up Greek before her vacation would like to discuss in Greek<br>
Cretan politics when she returns. A Mexican in New York wants to find other readers of<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 65<br>the paper Siempre — or of "Los Agachaclos, ” the most popular comic book. Somebody<br>
else wants to meet peers who, like himself, would like to increase their interest in the<br>
work of James Baldwin or of Bolivar.<br>The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify<br>
himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A<br>
computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the<br>
same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad<br>
scale for publicly valued activity.<br>In its most rudimentary form, communication between client and computer could be<br>
established by return mail. In big cities typewriter terminals could provide instantaneous<br>
responses. The only way to retrieve a name and address from the computer would be to<br>
list an activity for which a peer was sought. People using the system would become<br>
known only to their potential peers.<br>A complement to the computer could be a network of bulletin boards and classified<br>
newspaper ads, listing the activities for which the computer could not produce a match.<br>
No names would have to be given. Interested readers would then introduce their names<br>
into the system. A publicly supported peer-match network might be the only way to<br>
guarantee the right of free assembly and to train people in the exercise of this most<br>
fundamental civic activity.<br>The right of free assembly has been politically recognized and culturally accepted. We<br>
should now understand that this right is curtailed by laws that make some forms of<br>
assembly obligatory. This is especially the case with institutions which conscript<br>
according to age group, class, or sex, and which are very time-consuming. The army is<br>
one example. School is an even more outrageous one.<br>To deschool means to abolish the power of one person to oblige another person to attend<br>
a meeting. It also means recognizing the right of any person, of any age or sex, to call a<br>
meeting. This right has been drastically diminished by the institutionalization of<br>
meetings. "Meeting" originally referred to the result of an individual's act of gathering.<br>
Now it refers to the institutional product of some agency.<br>The ability of service institutions to acquire clients has far outgrown the ability of<br>
individuals to be heard independently of institutional media, which respond to individuals<br>
only if they are salable news. Peer-matching facilities should be available for individuals<br>
who want to bring people together as easily as the village bell called the villagers to<br>
council. School buildings— of doubtful value for conversion to other uses— could often<br>
serve this purpose.<br>The school system, in fact, may soon face a problem which churches have faced before:<br>
what to do with surplus space emptied by the defection of the faithful. Schools are as<br>
difficult to sell as temples. One way to provide for their continued use would be to give<br>
over the space to people from the neighborhood. Each could state what he would do in<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 66<br>the classroom and when, and a bulletin board would bring the available programs to the<br>
attention of the inquirers. Access to "class" would be free-or purchased with educational<br>
vouchers. The "teacher" could even be paid according to the number of pupils he could<br>
attract for any full two-hour period. I can imagine that very young leaders and great<br>
educators would be the two types most prominent in such a system. The same approach<br>
could be taken toward higher education. Students could be furnished with educational<br>
vouchers which entitled them to ten hours' yearly private consultation with the teacher of<br>
their choice— and, for the rest of their learning, depend on the library, the peer-matching<br>
network, and apprenticeships.<br>We must, of course, recognize the probability that such public matching devices would<br>
be abused for exploitative and immoral purposes, just as the telephone and the mails have<br>
been so abused. As with those networks, there must be some protection. I have proposed<br>
elsewhere a matching system which would allow only pertinent printed information, plus<br>
the name and address of the inquirer, to be used. Such a system would be virtually<br>
foolproof against abuse. Other arrangements could allow the addition of any book, film,<br>
TV program, or other item quoted from a special catalogue. Concern about the dangers of<br>
the system should not make us lose sight of its far greater benefits.<br>Some who share my concern for free speech and assembly will argue that peer-matching<br>
is an artificial means of bringing people together and would not be used by the poor— who<br>
need it most. Some people become genuinely agitated when one suggests the setting up<br>
of ad hoc encounters which are not rooted in the life of a local community. Others react<br>
when one suggests using a computer to sort and match client-identified interests. People<br>
cannot be drawn together in such an impersonal manner, they say. Common inquiry must<br>
be rooted in a history of shared experience at many levels, and must grow out of this<br>
experience-the development of neighborhood institutions, for example.<br>I sympathize with these objections, but I think they miss my point as well as their own. In<br>
the first place, the return to neighborhood life as the primary center of creative expression<br>
might actually work against the re-establishment of neighborhoods as political units.<br>
Centering demands on the neighborhood may, in fact, neglect an important liberating<br>
aspect of urban life— the ability of a person to participate simultaneously in several peer<br>
groups. Also, there is an important sense in which people who have never lived together<br>
in a physical community, may occasionally have far more experiences to share than those<br>
who have known each other from childhood. The great religions have always recognized<br>
the importance of far-off encounters, and the faithful have always found freedom through<br>
them; pilgrimage, monasticism, the mutual support of temples and sanctuaries reflect this<br>
awareness. Peer-matching could significantly help in making explicit the many potential<br>
but suppressed communities of the city.<br>Local communities are valuable. They are also a vanishing reality as men progressively<br>
let service institutions define their circles of social relationship. Milton Kotler in his<br>
recent book has shown that the imperialism of "downtown" deprives the neighborhood of<br>
its political significance. The protectionist attempt to resurrect the neighborhood as a<br>
cultural unit only supports this bureaucratic imperialism. Far from artificially removing<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 67<br>men from their local contexts to join abstract groupings, peer-matching should encourage<br>
the restoration of local life to cities from which it is now disappearing. A man who<br>
recovers his initiative to call his fellows into meaningful conversation may cease to settle<br>
for being separated from them by office protocol or suburban etiquette. Having once seen<br>
that doing things together depends on deciding to do so, men may even insist that their<br>
local communities become more open to creative political exchange.<br>We must recognize that city life tends to become immensely costly as city-dwellers must<br>
be taught to rely for every one of their needs on complex institutional services. It is<br>
extremely expensive to keep it even minimally livable. Peer-matching in the city could be<br>
a first step toward breaking down the dependence of citizens on bureaucratic civic<br>
services.<br>It would also be an essential step to providing new means of establishing public trust. In a<br>
schooled society we have come to rely more and more on the professional judgment of<br>
educators on the effect of their own work in order to decide whom we can or cannot trust:<br>
we go to the doctor, lawyer, or psychologist because we trust that anybody with the<br>
required amount of specialized educational treatment by other colleagues deserves our<br>
confidence.<br>In a deschooled society professionals could no longer claim the trust of their clients on<br>
the basis of their curricular pedigree, or ensure their standing by simply referring their<br>
clients to other professionals who approved of their schooling. Instead of placing trust in<br>
professionals, it should be possible, at any time, for any potential client to consult with<br>
other experienced clients of a professional about their satisfaction with him by means of<br>
another peer network easily set up by computer, or by a number of other means. Such<br>
networks could be seen as public utilities which permitted students to choose their<br>
teachers or patients their healers.<br>Professional Educators<br>As citizens have new choices, new chances for learning, their willingness to seek<br>
leadership should increase. We may expect that they will experience more deeply both<br>
their own independence and their need for guidance. As they are liberated from<br>
manipulation by others, they should learn to profit from the discipline others have<br>
acquired in a lifetime. Deschooling education should increase— rather than stifle— the<br>
search for men with practical wisdom who would be willing to sustain the newcomer in<br>
his educational adventure. As masters of their art abandon the claim to be superior<br>
informants or skill models, their claim to superior wisdom will begin to ring true.<br>With an increasing demand for masters, their supply should also increase. As the<br>
schoolmaster vanishes, conditions will arise which should bring forth the vocation of the<br>
independent educator. This may seem almost a contradiction in terms, so thoroughly have<br>
schools and teachers become complementary. Yet this is exactly what the development of<br>
the first three educational exchanges would tend to result in— and what would be required<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 68<br>to permit their full exploitation— for parents and other '"natural educators" need guidance,<br>
individual learners need assistance, and the networks need people to operate them.<br>Parents need guidance in directing their children on the road that leads to responsible<br>
educational independence. Learners need experienced leadership when they encounter<br>
rough terrain. These two needs are quite distinct: the first is a need for pedagogy, the<br>
second for intellectual leadership in all other fields of knowledge. The first calls for<br>
knowledge of human learning and of educational resources, the second for wisdom based<br>
on experience in any kind of exploration. Both kinds of experience are indispensable for<br>
effective educational endeavor. Schools package these functions into one role— and<br>
render the independent exercise of any of them if not disreputable at least suspect.<br>Three types of special educational competence should, in fact, be distinguished: one to<br>
create and operate the kinds of educational exchanges or networks outlined here; another<br>
to guide students and parents in the use of these networks; and a third to act as primus<br>
inter pares in undertaking difficult intellectual exploratory journeys. Only the former two<br>
can be conceived of as branches of an independent profession: educational administrators<br>
and pedagogical counselors. To design and operate the networks I have been describing<br>
would not require many people, but it would require people with the most profound<br>
understanding of education and administration, in a perspective quite different from and<br>
even opposed to that of schools.<br>While an independent educational profession of this kind would welcome many people<br>
whom the schools exclude, it would also exclude many whom the schools qualify. The<br>
establishment and operation of educational networks would require some designers and<br>
administrators, but not in the numbers or of the type required by the administration of<br>
schools. Student discipline, public relations, hiring, supervising, and firing teachers<br>
would have neither place nor counterpart in the networks I have been describing. Neither<br>
would curriculum-making, textbook-purchasing, the maintenance of grounds and<br>
facilities, or the supervision of interscholastic athletic competition. Nor would child<br>
custody, lesson-planning, and record-keeping, which now take up so much of the time of<br>
teachers, figure in the operation of educational networks. Instead, the operation of<br>
learning webs would require some of the skills and attitudes now expected from the staff<br>
of a museum, a library, an executive employment agency, or a maitre d'h™tel.<br>Today's educational administrators are concerned with controlling teachers and students<br>
to the satisfaction of others -trustees, legislatures, and corporate executives. Network<br>
builders and administrators would have to demonstrate genius at keeping themselves, and<br>
others, out of people's way, at facilitating en-counters among students, skill models,<br>
educational leaders, and educational objects. Many persons now attracted to teaching are<br>
profoundly authoritarian and would not be able to assume this task: building educational<br>
exchanges would mean making it easy for people— especially the young— to pursue goals<br>
which might contradict the ideals of the traffic manager who makes the pursuit possible.<br>If the networks I have described could emerge, the educational path of each student<br>
would be his own to follow, and only in retrospect would it take on the features of a<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 69<br>recognizable program. The wise student would periodically seek professional advice:<br>
assistance to set a new goal, insight into difficulties encountered, choice between possible<br>
methods. Even now, most persons would admit that the important services their teachers<br>
have rendered them are such advice or counsel, given at a chance meeting or in a tutorial.<br>
Pedagogues, in an unschooled world, would also come into their own, and be able to do<br>
what frustrated teachers pretend to pursue today.<br>While network administrators would concentrate primarily on the building and<br>
maintenance of roads providing access to resources, the pedagogue would help the<br>
student to find the path which for him could lead fastest to his goal. If a student wanted to<br>
learn spoken Cantonese from a Chinese neighbor, the pedagogue would be available to<br>
judge their proficiency, and to help them select the textbook and methods most suitable to<br>
their talents, character, and the time available for study. He could counsel the would-be<br>
airplane mechanic on finding the best places for apprenticeship. He could recommend<br>
books to somebody who wanted to find challenging peers to discuss African history. Like<br>
the network administrator, the pedagogical counselor would conceive of himself as a<br>
professional educator. Access to either could be gained by individuals through the use of<br>
educational vouchers.<br>The role of the educational initiator or leader, the master or "true" leader, is somewhat<br>
more elusive than that of the professional administrator or the pedagogue. This is so<br>
because leadership is itself hard to define. In practice, an individual is a leader if people<br>
follow his initiative and become apprentices in his progressive discoveries. Frequently,<br>
this involves a prophetic vision of entirely new standards— quite understandable today— in<br>
which present "wrong" will turn out to be "right." In a society which would honor the<br>
right to call assemblies through peer-matching, the ability to take educational initiative on<br>
a specific subject would be as wide as access to learning itself. But, of course, there is a<br>
vast difference between the initiative taken by someone to call a fruitful meeting to<br>
discuss this essay and the ability of someone to provide leadership in the systematic<br>
exploration of its implications.<br>Leadership also does not depend on being right. As Thomas Kuhn points out, in a period<br>
of constantly changing paradigms most of the very distinguished leaders are bound to be<br>
proven wrong by the test of hindsight. Intellectual leadership does depend on superior<br>
intellectual discipline and imagination and the willingness to associate with others in their<br>
exercise. A learner, for example, may think that there is an analogy between the U.S.<br>
antislavery movement or the Cuban Revolution and what is happening in Harlem. The<br>
educator who is himself a historian can show him how to appreciate the flaws in such an<br>
analogy. He may retrace his own steps as a historian. He may invite the learner to<br>
participate in his own research. In both cases he will apprentice his pupil in a critical art—<br>
which is rare in school— and which money or other favors cannot buy.<br>The relationship of master and disciple is not restricted to intellectual discipline. It has its<br>
counterpart in the arts, in physics, in religion, in psychoanalysis, and in pedagogy. It fits<br>
mountain-climbing, silverworking and politics, cabinetmaking and personnel<br>
administration. What is common to all true master-pupil relationships is the awareness<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 70<br>both share that their relationship is literally priceless and in very different ways a<br>
privilege for both.<br>Charlatans, demagogues, proselytizers, corrupt masters, and simoniacal priests, tricksters,<br>
miracle workers, and messiahs have proven capable of assuming leadership roles and<br>
thus show the dangers of any dependence of a disciple on the master. Different societies<br>
have taken different measures to defend themselves against these counterfeit teachers.<br>
Indians relied on caste-lineage, Eastern Jews on the spiritual discipleship of rabbis, high<br>
periods of Christianity on an exemplary life of monastic virtue, other periods on<br>
hierarchical orders. Our society relies on certification by schools. It is doubtful that this<br>
procedure provides a better screening, but if it should be claimed that it does, then the<br>
counterclaim can be made that it does so at the cost of making personal discipleship<br>
almost vanish.<br>In practice, there will always be a fuzzy line between the teacher of skills and the<br>
educational leaders identified above, and there are no practical reasons why access to<br>
some leaders could not be gained by discovering the "master" in the drill teacher who<br>
introduces students to his discipline.<br>On the other hand, what characterizes the true master-disciple relationship is its priceless<br>
character. Aristotle speaks of it as a ""moral type of friendship, which is not on fixed<br>
terms: it makes a gift, or does whatever it does, as to a friend." Thomas Aquinas says of<br>
this kind of teaching that inevitably it is an act of love and mercy. This kind of teaching is<br>
always a luxury for the teacher and a form of leisure (in Greek, "scliole") for him and his<br>
pupil: an activity meaningful for both, having no ulterior purpose.<br>To rely for true intellectual leadership on the desire of gifted people to provide it is<br>
obviously necessary even in our society, but it could not be made into a policy now. We<br>
must first construct a society in which personal acts themselves reacquire a value higher<br>
than that of making things and manipulating people. In such a society exploratory,<br>
inventive, creative teaching would logically be counted among the most desirable forms<br>
of leisurely "unemployment." But we do not have to wait until the advent of utopia. Even<br>
now one of the most important consequences of deschooling and the establishment of<br>
peer-matching facilities would be the initiative which "masters" could take to assemble<br>
congenial disciples. It would also, as we have seen, provide ample opportunity for<br>
potential disciples to share information or to select a master.<br>Schools are not the only institutions which pervert professions by packaging roles.<br>
Hospitals render home care increasingly impossible— and then justify hospitalization as a<br>
benefit to the sick. At the same time, the doctor's legitimacy and ability to work come<br>
increasingly to depend on his association with a hospital, even though he is still less<br>
totally dependent on it than are teachers on schools. The same could be said about courts,<br>
which overcrowd their calendars as new transactions acquire legal solemnity, and thus<br>
delay justice. Or it could be said about churches, which succeed in making a captive<br>
profession out of a free vocation. The result in each case is scarce service at higher cost,<br>
and greater income to the less competent members of the profession.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 71<br>So long as the older professions monopolize superior income and prestige it is difficult to<br>
reform them. The profession of the schoolteacher should be easier to reform, and not only<br>
because it is of more recent origin. The educational profession now claims a<br>
comprehensive monopoly; it claims the exclusive competence to apprentice not only its<br>
own novices but those of other professions as well. This overexpansion renders it<br>
vulnerable to any profession which would reclaim the right to teach its own apprentices.<br>
Schoolteachers are overwhelmingly badly paid and frustrated by the tight control of the<br>
school system. The most enterprising and gifted among them would probably find more<br>
congenial work, more independence, and even higher incomes by specializing as skill<br>
models, network administrators, or guidance specialists.<br>Finally, the dependence of the registered student on the certified teacher can be broken<br>
more easily than his dependence on other professionals— for instance, that of a<br>
hospitalized patient on his doctor. If schools ceased to be compulsory, teachers who find<br>
their satisfaction in the exercise of pedagogical authority in the classroom would be left<br>
only with pupils who were attracted by their style. The disestablishment of our present<br>
professional structure could begin with the dropping out of the schoolteacher.<br>The disestablishment of schools will inevitably happen— and it will happen surprisingly<br>
fast. It cannot be retarded very much longer, and it is hardly necessary to promote it<br>
vigorously, for this is being done now. What is worthwhile is to try to orient it in a<br>
hopeful direction, for it could take place in either of two diametrically opposed ways.<br>The first would be the expansion of the mandate of the pedagogue and his increasing<br>
control over society even outside school. With the best of intentions and simply by<br>
expanding the rhetoric now used in school, the present crisis in the schools could provide<br>
educators with an excuse to use all the networks of contemporary society to funnel their<br>
messages to us— for our own good. Deschooling, which we cannot stop, could mean the<br>
advent of a ""brave new world" dominated by well-intentioned administrators of<br>
programmed instruction.<br>On the other hand, the growing awareness on the part of governments, as well as of<br>
employers, taxpayers, enlightened pedagogues, and school administrators, that graded<br>
curricular teaching for certification has become harmful could offer large masses of<br>
people an extraordinary opportunity: that of preserving the right of equal access to the<br>
tools both of learning and of sharing with others what they know or believe. But this<br>
would require that the educational revolution be guided by certain goals:<br>1 . To liberate access to things by abolishing the control which persons and institutions<br>
now exercise over their educational values.<br>
<br>To liberate the sharing of skills by guaranteeing freedom to teach or exercise them on<br>
request.
<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 72<br>
<br>
To liberate the critical and creative resources of people by returning to individual<br>
persons the ability to call and hold meetings— an ability now increasingly monopolized by<br>
institutions which claim to speak for the people.

<br>
To liberate the individual from the obligation to shape his expectations to the services<br>
offered by any established profession— by providing him with the opportunity to draw on<br>
the experience of his peers and to entrust himself to the teacher, guide, adviser, or healer<br>
of his choice. Inevitably the deschooling of society will blur the distinctions between<br>
economics, education, and politics on which the stability of the present world order and<br>
the stability of nations now rest.

<br>Our review of educational institutions leads us to a review of our image of man. The<br>
creature whom schools need as a client has neither the autonomy nor the motivation to<br>
grow on his own. We can recognize universal schooling as the culmination of a<br>
Promethean enterprise, and speak about the alternative as a world fit to live in for<br>
Epimethean man. While we can specify that the alternative to scholastic funnels is a<br>
world made transparent by true communication webs, and while we can specify very<br>
concretely how these could function, we can only expect the Epimethean nature of man<br>
to re-emerge; we can neither plan nor produce it.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 73<br>7<br>Rebirth of Epimethean Man<br>Our society resembles the ultimate machine which I once saw in a New York toy shop. It<br>
was a metal casket which, when you touched a switch, snapped open to reveal a<br>
mechanical hand. Chromed fingers reached out for the lid, pulled it down, and locked it<br>
from the inside. It was a box; you expected to be able to take something out of it; yet all it<br>
contained was a mechanism for closing the cover. This contraption is the opposite of<br>
Pandora's "box."<br>The original Pandora, the All-Giver, was an Earth goddess in prehistoric matriarchal<br>
Greece. She let all ills escape from her amphora (pythos). But she closed the lid before<br>
Hope could escape. The history of modem man begins with the degradation of Pandora's<br>
myth and comes to an end in the self-sealing casket. It is the history of the Promethean<br>
endeavor to forge institutions in order to corral each of the rampant ills. It is the history of<br>
fading hope and rising expectations.<br>To understand what this means we must rediscover the distinction between hope and<br>
expectation. Hope, in its strong sense, means trusting faith in the goodness of nature,<br>
while expectation, as I will use it here, means reliance on results which are planned and<br>
controlled by man. Hope centers desire on a person from whom we await a gift.<br>
Expectation looks forward to satisfaction from a predictable process which will produce<br>
what we have the right to claim. The Promethean ethos has now eclipsed hope. Survival<br>
of the human race depends on its rediscovery as a social force.<br>The original Pandora was sent to Earth with ajar which contained all ills; of good things,<br>
it contained only hope. Primitive man lived in this world of hope. He relied on the<br>
munificence of nature, on the handouts of gods, and on the instincts of his tribe to enable<br>
him to subsist. Classical Greeks began to replace hope with expectations. In their version<br>
of Pandora she released both evils and goods. They remembered her mainly for the ills<br>
she had unleashed. And, most significantly, they forgot that the All-Giver was also the<br>
keeper of hope.<br>The Greeks told the story of two brothers, Prometheus and Epimetheus. The former<br>
warned the latter to leave Pandora alone. Instead, he married her. In classical Greece the<br>
name "Epimetheus," which means "hindsight," was interpreted to mean "dull" or "dumb."<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 74<br>By the time Hesiod retold the story in its classical form, the Greeks had become moral<br>
and misogynous patriarchs who panicked at the thought of the first woman. They built a<br>
rational and authoritarian society. Men engineered institutions through which they<br>
planned to cope with the rampant ills. They became conscious of their power to fashion<br>
the world and make it produce services they also learned to expect. They wanted their<br>
own needs and the future demands of their children to be shaped by their artifacts. They<br>
became lawgivers, architects, and authors, the makers of constitutions, cities, and works<br>
of art to serve as examples for their offspring. Primitive man had relied on mythical<br>
participation in sacred rites to initiate individuals into the lore of society, but the classical<br>
Greeks recognized as true men only those citizens who let themselves be fitted by<br>
paidela (education) into the institutions their elders had planned.<br>The developing myth reflects the transition from a world in which dreams were<br>
interpreted to a world in which oracles were made. From immemorial time, the Earth<br>
Goddess had been worshipped on the slope of Mount Parnassus, which was the center<br>
and navel of the Earth. There, at Delphi (from deiphys, the womb), slept Gaia, the sister<br>
of Chaos and Eros. Her son, Python the dragon, guarded her moonlit and dewy dreams,<br>
until Apollo the Sun God, the architect of Troy, rose from the east, slew the dragon, and<br>
became the owner of Gaia's cave. His priests took over her temple. They employed a<br>
local maiden, sat her on a tripod over Earth's smoking navel, and made her drowsy with<br>
fumes. They then rhymed her ecstatic utterances into hexameters of self-fulfilling<br>
prophecies. From all over the Peloponnesus men brought their problems to Apollo's<br>
sanctuary. The oracle was consulted on social options, such as measures to be taken to<br>
stop a plague or a famine, to choose the right constitution for Sparta or the propitious<br>
sites for cities which later became Byzantium and Chalcedon. The never-erring arrow<br>
became Apollo's symbol. Everything about him became purposeful and useful.<br>In the Republic, describing the ideal state, Plato already excludes popular music. Only the<br>
harp and Apollo's lyre would be permitted in towns because their harmony alone creates<br>
"the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the strain of the unfortunate and the<br>
strain of the fortunate, the strain of courage and the strain of temperance which befit the<br>
citizen." City-dwellers panicked before Pan's flute and its power to awaken the instincts.<br>
Only "the shepherds may play [Pan's] pipes and they only in the country."<br>Man assumed responsibility for the laws under which he wanted to live and for the<br>
casting of the environment into his own image. Primitive initiation by Mother Earth into<br>
mythical life was transformed into the education (paideia) of the citizen who would feel<br>
at home in the forum.<br>To the primitive the world was governed by fate, fact, and necessity. By stealing fire<br>
from the gods, Prometheus turned facts into problems, called necessity into question, and<br>
defied fate. Classical man framed a civilized context for human perspective. He was<br>
aware that he could defy fate-nature-environment, but only at his own risk. Contemporary<br>
man goes further; he attempts to create the world in his image, to build a totally man-<br>
made environment, and then discovers that he can do so only on the condition of<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 75<br>constantly remaking himself to fit it. We now must face the fact that man himself is at<br>
stake.<br>Life today in New York produces a very peculiar vision of what is and what can be, and<br>
without this vision life in New York is impossible. A child on the streets of New York<br>
never touches anything which has not been scientifically developed, engineered, planned,<br>
and sold to someone. Even the trees are there because the Parks Department decided to<br>
put them there. The jokes the child hears on television have been programmed at a high<br>
cost. The refuse with which he plays in the streets of Harlem is made of broken packages<br>
planned for somebody else. Even desires and fears are institutionally shaped. Power and<br>
violence are organized and managed: the gangs versus the police. Learning itself is<br>
defined as the consumption of subject matter, which is the result of researched, planned,<br>
and promoted programs. Whatever good there is, is the product of some specialized<br>
institution. It would be foolish to demand something which some institution cannot<br>
produce. The child of the city cannot expect anything which lies outside the possible<br>
development of institutional process. Even his fantasy is prompted to produce science<br>
fiction. He can experience the poetic surprise of the unplanned only through his<br>
encounter with "dirt," blunder, or failure: the orange peel in the gutter, the puddle in the<br>
street, the breakdown of order, program, or machine are the only take-offs for creative<br>
fancy. "Goofing off" becomes the only poetry at hand.<br>Since there is nothing desirable which has not been planned, the city child soon<br>
concludes that we will always be able to design an institution for our every want. He<br>
takes for granted the power of process to create value. Whether the goal is meeting a<br>
mate, integrating a neighborhood, or acquiring reading skills, it will be defined in such a<br>
way that its achievement can be engineered. The man who knows that nothing in demand<br>
is out of production soon expects that nothing produced can be out of demand. If a moon<br>
vehicle can be designed, so can the demand to go to the moon. Not to go where one can<br>
go would be subversive. It would unmask as folly the assumption that every satisfied<br>
demand entails the discovery of an even greater unsatisfied one. Such insight would stop<br>
progress. Not to produce what is possible would expose the law of "rising expectations"<br>
as a euphemism for a growing frustration gap, which is the motor of a society built on the<br>
coproduction of services and increased demand.<br>The state of mind of the modem city-dweller appears in the mythical tradition only under<br>
the image of Hell: Sisyphus, who for a while had chained Thanatos (death), must roll a<br>
heavy stone up the hill to the pinnacle of Hell, and the stone always slips from his grip<br>
just when he is about to reach the top. Tantalus, who was invited by the gods to share<br>
their meal, and on that occasion stole their secret of how to prepare all-healing ambrosia,<br>
which bestowed immortality, suffers eternal hunger and thirst standing in a river of<br>
receding waters, overshadowed by fruit trees with receding branches. A world of ever-<br>
rising demands is not just evil-it can be spoken of only as Hell.<br>Man has developed the frustrating power to demand anything because he cannot visualize<br>
anything which an institution cannot do for him. Surrounded by all-powerful tools, man<br>
is reduced to a tool of his tools. Each of the institutions meant to exorcise one of the<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page #76<br>primeval evils has become a fail-safe, self-sealing coffin for man. Man is trapped in the<br>
boxes he makes to contain the ills Pandora allowed to escape. The blackout of reality in<br>
the smog produced by our tools has enveloped us. Quite suddenly we find ourselves in<br>
the darkness of our own trap.<br>Reality itself has become dependent on human decision. The same President who ordered<br>
the ineffective invasion of Cambodia could equally well order the effective use of the<br>
atom. The "Hiroshima switch" now can cut the navel of the Earth. Man has acquired the<br>
power to make Chaos overwhelm both Eros and Gaia. This new power of man to cut the<br>
navel of the Earth is a constant reminder that our institutions not only create their own<br>
ends, but also have the power to put an end to themselves and to us. The absurdity of<br>
modern institutions is evident in the case of the military. Modem weapons can defend<br>
freedom, civilization, and life only by annihilating them. Security in military language<br>
means the ability to do away with the Earth.<br>The absurdity that underlies nonmilitary institutions is no less manifest. There is no<br>
switch in them to activate their destructive power, but neither do they need a switch.<br>Their grip is already fastened to the lid of the world. They create needs faster than they<br>
can create satisfaction, and in the process of trying to meet the needs they generate, they<br>
consume the Earth. This is true for agriculture and manufacturing, and no less for<br>
medicine and education. Modem agriculture poisons and exhausts the soil. The "green<br>
revolution" can, by means of new seeds, triple the output of an acre— but only with an<br>
even greater proportional increase of fertilizers, insecticides, water, and power.<br>
Manufacturing of these, as of all other goods, pollutes the oceans and the atmosphere and<br>
degrades irreplaceable resources. If combustion continues to increase at present rates, we<br>
will soon consume the oxygen of the atmosphere faster than it can be replaced. We have<br>
no reason to believe that fission or fusion can replace combustion without equal or higher<br>
hazards. Medicine men replace midwives and promise to make man into something else:<br>
genetically planned, pharmacologically sweetened, and capable of more protracted<br>
sickness. The contemporary ideal is a pan-hygienic world: a world in which all contacts<br>
between men, and between men and their world, are the result of foresight and<br>
manipulation. School has become the planned process which tools man for a planned<br>
world, the principal tool to trap man in man s trap. It is sup-posed to shape each man to<br>
an adequate level for playing a part in this world game. Inexorably we cultivate, treat,<br>
produce, and school the world out of existence.<br>The military institution is evidently absurd. The absurdity of nonmilitary institutions is<br>
more difficult to face. It is even more frightening, precisely because it operates<br>
inexorably. We know which switch must stay open to avoid an atomic holocaust. No<br>
switch detains an ecological Armageddon.<br>In classical antiquity, man had discovered that the world could be made according to<br>
man's plans, and with this insight he perceived that it was inherently precarious, dramatic<br>
and comical. Democratic institutions evolved and man was presumed worthy of trust<br>
within their framework. Expectations from due process and confidence in human nature<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 77<br>kept each other in balance. The traditional professions developed and with them the<br>
institutions needed for their exercise.<br>Surreptitiously, reliance on institutional process has replaced dependence on personal<br>
good will. The world has lost its humane dimension and reacquired the factual necessity<br>
and fatefulness which were characteristic of primitive times. But while the chaos of the<br>
barbarian was constantly ordered in the name of mysterious, anthropomorphic gods,<br>
today only man's planning can be given as a reason for the world being as it, is. Man has<br>
become the plaything of scientists, engineers, and planners.<br>We see this logic at work in ourselves and in others. I know a Mexican village through<br>
which not more than a dozen cars drive each day. A Mexican was playing dominoes on<br>
the new hard-surface road in front of his house— where he had probably played and sat<br>
since his youth. A car sped through and killed him. The tourist who reported the event to<br>
me was deeply upset, and yet he said: "The man had it coming to him."<br>At first sight, the tourist's remark is no different from the statement of some primitive<br>
bushman reporting the death of a fellow who had collided with a taboo and had therefore<br>
died. But the two statements carry opposite meanings. The primitive can blame some<br>
tremendous and dumb transcendence, while the tourist is in awe of the inexorable logic of<br>
the machine. The primitive does not sense responsibility; the tourist senses it, but denies<br>
it. In both the primitive and the tourist the classical mode of drama, the style of tragedy,<br>
the logic of personal endeavor and rebellion is absent. The primitive man has not become<br>
conscious of it, and the tourist has lost it. The myth of the Bushman and the myth of the<br>
American are made of inert, inhuman forces. Neither experiences tragic rebellion. For the<br>
Bushman, the event follows the laws of magic; for the American, it follows the laws of<br>
science. The event puts him under the spell of the laws of mechanics, which for him<br>
govern physical, social, and psychological events.<br>The mood of 1971 is propitious for a major change of direction in search of a hopeful<br>
future. Institutional goals continuously contradict institutional products. The poverty<br>
program produces more poor, the war in Asia more Vietcong, technical assistance more<br>
underdevelopment. Birth control clinics increase survival rates and boost the population;<br>
schools produce more dropouts; and the curb on one kind of pollution usually increases<br>
another.<br>Consumers are faced with the realization that the more they can buy, the more deceptions<br>
they must swallow. Until recently it seemed logical that the blame for this pandemic<br>
inflation of dysfunctions could be laid either on the limping of scientific discovery behind<br>
the technological demands or on the perversity of ethnic, ideological, or class enemies.<br>
Both the expectations of a scientific millennium and of a war to end all wars have<br>
declined.<br>For the experienced consumer, there is no way back to a na*vc reliance on magical<br>
technologies. Too many people have had bad experiences with neurotic computers,<br>
hospital-bred infections, and jams wherever there is traffic on the road, in the air, or on<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page# 78<br>the phone. Only ten years ago conventional wisdom anticipated a better life based on an<br>
increase in scientific discovery. Now scientists frighten children. The moon shots provide<br>
a fascinating demonstration that human failure can be almost eliminated among the<br>
operators of complex systems-yet this does not allay our fears that the human failure to<br>
consume according to instruction might spread out of control.<br>For the social reformer there is no way back, either, to the assumptions of the forties. The<br>
hope has vanished that the problem of justly distributing goods can be sidetracked by<br>
creating an abundance of them. The cost of the minimum package capable of satisfying<br>
modern tastes has skyrocketed, and what makes tastes modern is their obsolescence prior<br>
even to satisfaction.<br>The limits of the Earth's resources have become evident. No breakthrough in science or<br>
technology could provide every man in the world with the commodities and services<br>
which are now available to the poor of rich countries. For instance, it would take the<br>
extraction of one hundred times the present amounts of iron, tin, copper, and lead to<br>
achieve such a goal, with even the "lightest" alternative technology.<br>Finally, teachers, doctors, and social workers realize that their distinct professional<br>
ministrations have one aspect-at least-in common. They create further demands for the<br>
institutional treatments they provide, faster than they can provide service institutions.<br>Not just some part, but the very logic, of conventional wisdom is becoming suspect. Even<br>
the laws of economy seem unconvincing outside the narrow parameters which apply to<br>
the social, geographic area where most of the money is concentrated. Money is, indeed,<br>
the cheapest currency, but only in an economy geared to efficiency measured in monetary<br>
terms. Both capitalist and Communist countries in their various forms are committed to<br>
measuring efficiency in cost-benefit ratios expressed in dollars. Capitalism flaunts a<br>
higher standard of living as its claim to superiority. Communism boasts of a higher<br>
growth rate as an index of its ultimate triumph. But under either ideology the total cost of<br>
increasing efficiency increases geometrically. The largest institutions compete most<br>
fiercely for resources which are not listed in any inventory: the air, the ocean, silence,<br>
sunlight, and health. They bring the scarcity of these resources to public attention only<br>
when they are almost irremediably degraded. Everywhere nature becomes poisonous,<br>
society inhumane, and the inner life is invaded and personal vocation smothered.<br>A society committed to the institutionalization of values identifies the production of<br>
goods and services with the demand for such. Education which makes you need the<br>
product is included in the price of the product. School is the advertising agency which<br>
makes you believe that you need the society as it is. In such a society marginal value has<br>
become constantly self-transcendent. It forces the few largest consumers to compete for<br>
the power to deplete the earth, to fill their own swelling bellies, to discipline smaller<br>
consumers, and to deactivate those who still find satisfaction in making do with what<br>
they have. The ethos of nonsatiety is thus at the root of physical depredation, social<br>
polarization, and psychological passivity.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 79<br>When values have been institutionalized in planned and engineered processes, members<br>
of modern society believe that the good life consists in having institutions which define<br>
the values that both they and their society believe they need. Institutional value can be<br>
defined as the level of output of an institution. The corresponding value of man is<br>
measured by his ability to consume and degrade these institutional outputs, and thus<br>
create a new-even higher-demand. The value of institutionalized man depends on his<br>
capacity as an incinerator. To use an image— he has become the idol of his handiworks.<br>
Man now defines himself as the fur-nace which bums up the values produced by his<br>
tools. And there is no limit to his capacity. His is the act of Prometheus carried to an<br>
extreme.<br>The exhaustion and pollution of the earth's resources is, above all, the result of a<br>
corruption in man's self-image, of a regression in his consciousness. Some would like to<br>
speak about a mutation of collective consciousness which leads to a conception of man as<br>
an organism dependent not on nature and individuals, but rather on institutions. This<br>
institutionalization of substantive values, this belief that a planned process of treatment<br>
ultimately gives results desired by the recipient, this consumer ethos, is at the heart of the<br>
Promethean fallacy.<br>Efforts to find a new balance in the global milieu depend on the deinstitutionalization of<br>
values.<br>The suspicion that something is structurally wrong with the vision of homo faber is<br>
common to a growing minority in capitalist, Communist, and "underdeveloped" countries<br>
alike. This suspicion is the shared characteristic of a new elite. To it belong people of all<br>
classes, incomes, faiths, and civilizations. They have 'become wary of the myths of the<br>
majority: of scientific utopias, of ideological diabolism, and of the expectation of the<br>
distribution of goods and services with some degree of equality. They share with the<br>
majority the sense of being trapped. They share with the majority the awareness that most<br>
new policies adopted by broad consensus consistently lead to results which are glaringly<br>
opposed to their stated aims. Yet whereas the Promethean majority of would-be<br>
spacemen still evades the structural issue, the emergent minority is critical of the<br>
scientific dens ex mach ina, the ideological panacea, and the hunt for devils and witches.<br>
This minority begins to formulate its suspicion that our constant deceptions tie us to<br>
contemporary institutions as the chains bound Prometheus to his rock. Hopeful trust and<br>
classical irony (eironeia) must conspire to expose the Promethean fallacy. Prometheus is<br>
usually thought to mean "foresight," or sometimes even "he who makes the North Star<br>
progress." He tricked the gods out of their monopoly of fire, taught men to use it in the<br>
forging of iron, became the god of technologists, and wound up in iron chains.<br>The Pythia of Delphi has now been replaced by a computer which hovers above panels<br>
and punch cards. The hexameters of the oracle have given way to sixteen-bit codes of<br>
instructions. Man the helmsman has turned the rudder over to the cybernetic machine.<br>The ultimate machine emerges to direct our destinies. Children phantasize flying their<br>
spacecrafts away from a crepuscular earth.<br>Deschooling Society<br>Page # 80<br>From the perspectives of the Man on the Moon, Prometheus could recognize sparkling<br>
blue Gaia as the planet of Hope and as the Arc of Mankind. A new sense of the finiteness<br>
of the Earth and a new nostalgia now can open man's eyes to the choice of his brother<br>
Epimetheus to wed the Earth with Pandora.<br>At this point the Greek myth turns into hopeful prophecy because it tells us that the son<br>
of Prometheus was Deucalion, the Helmsman of the Ark who like Noah outrode the<br>
Flood to become the father of a new mankind which he made from the earth with Pyrrha,<br>
the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora. We are gaining insight into the meaning of the<br>
Pythos which Pandora brought from the gods as being the inverse of the Box: our Vessel<br>
and Ark.<br>We now need a name for those who value hope above expectations. We need a name for<br>
those who love people more than products, those who believe that<br>No people are uninteresting. Their fate is<br>
like the chronicle of planets. Nothing in<br>
them is not particular, and planet is<br>
dissimilar from planet.<br>We need a name for those who love the earth on which each can meet the other,<br>And if a man lived in obscurity making his<br>
friends in that obscurity, obscurity is not<br>
uninteresting.<br>We need a name for those who collaborate with their Promethean brother in the lighting<br>
of the fire and the shaping of iron, but who do so to enhance their ability to tend and care<br>
and wait upon the other, knowing that<br>to each his world is private, and in that<br>
world one excellent minute. And in that<br>
world one tragic minute.<br>These are private.* [The three quotations are from ""People"' from the book Selected<br>

 <br>The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.<br>The origins of the Internet date back to research to enable time-sharing of computer resources and the development of packet switching in the 1960s. The set of rules (communication protocols) to enable internetworking on the Internet arose from research and development commissioned in the 1970s by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense in collaboration with universities and researchers across the United States and in the United Kingdom and France. The ARPANET initially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the United States to enable resource sharing. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, encouraged worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies and the merger of many networks using DARPA's Internet protocol suite. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s, as well as the advent of the World Wide Web, marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, subsequent commercialization is what incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.<br>Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing have adapted to website technology or have been reshaped into blogging, web feeds, and online news aggregators. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services. Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.<br>The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. The overarching definitions of the two principal name spaces on the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today's list of the New Seven Wonders.<br><br>File sharing is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of "mirror" servers or peer-to-peer networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed—usually fully encrypted—across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.<br>Streaming media is the real-time delivery of digital media for immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet "broadcasters" who never had on-air <a data-href="license" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/License/license.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">license</a>s. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access online media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical webcasts to on-demand popular multimedia services. Podcasting is a variation on this theme, where—usually audio—material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a portable media player to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.<br>Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth. For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.<br>Webcams are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the Panama Canal, traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video chat rooms and video conferencing are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with more than two billion users. It uses an HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files. Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. YouTube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily. ]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/Internet/the Internet.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/Internet/the Internet.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 02:15:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creative Commons Licenses]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The Problem<br>Dedicating works to the public domain is difficult if not impossible for those wanting to contribute their works for public use before applicable copyright or database protection terms expire. Few if any jurisdictions have a process for doing so easily and reliably. Laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as to what rights are automatically granted and how and when they expire or may be voluntarily relinquished. More challenging yet, many legal systems effectively prohibit any attempt by these owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly moral rights, even when the author wishing to do so is well informed and resolute about doing so and contributing their work to the public domain.<br>
A Solution<br>CC0 helps solve this problem by giving creators a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law. CC0 is a universal instrument that is not adapted to the laws of any particular legal jurisdiction, similar to many open source software <a data-href="license" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/License/license.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">license</a>s. And while no tool, not even CC0, can guarantee a complete relinquishment of all copyright and database rights in every jurisdiction, we believe it provides the best and most complete alternative for contributing a work to the public domain given the many complex and diverse copyright and database systems around the world.<br>
Using CC0<br>Unlike the Public Domain Mark, CC0 should not be used to mark works already free of known copyright and database restrictions and in the public domain throughout the world. However, it can be used to waive copyright and database rights to the extent you may have these rights in your work under the laws of at least one jurisdiction, even if your work is free of restrictions in others. Doing so clarifies the status of your work unambiguously worldwide and facilitates reuse.<br>You should only apply CC0 to your own work, unless you have the necessary rights to apply CC0 to another person’s work.]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/License/Creative Commons Licenses.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/License/Creative Commons Licenses.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 02:15:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[license]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>A license (US) or licence (Commonwealth) is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit).<br>A license is granted by a party (licensor) to another party (licensee) as an element of an agreement between those parties. In the case of a license issued by a government, the license is obtained by applying for it. In the case of a private party, it is by a specific agreement, usually in writing (such as a lease or other contract). The simplest definition is "A license is a promise not to sue", because a license usually either permits the licensed party to engage in an illegal activity, and subject to prosecution, without the license (e.g. fishing, driving an automobile, or operating a broadcast radio or television station), or it permits the licensed party to do something that would violate the rights of the licensing party (e.g. make copies of a copyrighted work), which, without the license, the licensed party could be sued, civilly, criminally, or both.<br>In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee or proving a capability (or both). The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to allow them to set conditions and limitations.<br>A licensor may grant a license under intellectual property laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a patented invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor. A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a term, territory, renewal provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor.<br>Term: many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement.<br>Territory: a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. For example, a license with a territory limited to "North America" (Mexico/United States/Canada) would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Japan.<br>Again, a shorthand definition of a license is "a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee". That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so.<br>Intellectual property licensing plays a major role in business, academia and broadcasting. Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Land licensing (proprietary licensing) and IP licensing.<br>
Real property licenses<br>A license provides one party with the authority to act on another's land, when such action would typically amount to trespass absent that license. A key distinction between licenses and leases is that a license grants the licensee a revocable non-assignable privilege to act upon the land of the licensor, without granting any possessory interest in the land. Once a license is agreed upon, the licensee may occupy the land only so far as is necessary to complete the act. Another key distinction between a license and a lease is that leases are generally required to be in writing, where the statute of frauds requires it, while licenses can be made orally.<br>
Creation<br>A license is generally created by an express or implied agreement. The licensor must agree to the license which can be shown in writing or the licensors acquiescence in its exercise. Furthermore, unlike many other contractual agreements, a license does not require consideration, a license can be created with or without it. Moreover, whether an agreement is held to be a "license" and not a lease will depend on three essential characteristics of a license: (1) a clause allowing the licensor to revoke "at will"; (2) the retention by the licensor of absolute control over the premises; and (3) the licensor's supplying to the licensee all of the essential services required for the licensee's permitted use of the premises.<br>
Termination<br>Under a pure licensing agreement, the licensor, under its terms and by common-law, can cancel the agreement at will and without cause, unless it is coupled with an interest or made irrevocable by contract. A license that has been coupled with an interest is not revocable by the licensor without exposure to liability and potential damages. In the event a license is coupled with an interest, the licensor must provide reasonable time for the licensee to remove that interest from the property prior to termination. Additionally, because a license does not confer any possessory interest in the licensee, in the event of a sale of the property, the license is terminated and cannot be enforced against the new owners of that property. Moreover, the death of either the licensee or licensor will terminate the agreement.<br>
Remedies<br>If a license is revocable at will by the licensor, courts will be unable to grant specific performance in favor of the licensee. A licensee would be unsuccessful in bringing forcible entry claims or a detainer proceeding because the licensee was never granted any possessory interest. The Licensee would also not be able to recover damages for money spent unless they are able to show detrimental reliance on the license. In certain cases, however, licenses can be made irrevocable, and specific performance may be granted. Where a license is made with a set term period and valid consideration is transferred, revocation of the license prior to the terms expiration may raise breach of contract claims that could provide damages against the licensor. Furthermore, once the licensor terminates or revokes the license, notice is statutorily required prior to the commencement of any special proceeding to recover possession of the property (e.g., in NY that requirement is 10 days).<br>
Mass licensing of software<br>Mass distributed software is used by individuals on personal computers under license from the developer of that software. Such license is typically included in a more extensive end-user license agreement (EULA) entered into upon the installation of that software on a computer. Typically, a license is associated with a unique code, that when approved grants the end user access to the software in question.<br>Under a typical end-user license agreement, the user may install the software on a limited number of computers.<br>The enforceability of end-user license agreements is sometimes questioned.<br>As of 2020, there are various ways to license software with different kinds of licensing models, which allow software vendors to profit from their product offerings in flexible ways.<br>
Patent licensing<br>Like other intellectual property, patent owners may grant permission to others to engage in conduct that would otherwise be within the scope of a patent. For example, a patent owner may authorize a licensee to make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import a patented product. Such agreements are typically referred to as a patent license agreement or a covenant not to sue. These agreements can last for a specific period of time (such as 5 years) or for the entire life of the patent (i.e., until the patent expires). Patent license agreements may also be exclusive (i.e., the licensee is the only person or entity that is allowed to sell, make, use, offer to sell, or import the patented invention) or non-exclusive (i.e., the licensee is simply one of several entities who has rights under the patent). Finally, any rights given under the agreement may be limited to a particular "field of use" (e.g., a licensee may be able to practice an invention in the field of consumer electronics, but not in the field of industrial electronics).<br>Often, patent owners will require a licensee to pay money in exchange for granting a patent license. Such payments are referred to as royalty payments and come primarily in two forms: lump sum or running royalty. A lump sum royalty involves an upfront, one-time payment, while a running royalty typically involves periodic payments (e.g., quarterly or annual) based on the number of patented products sold or imported.<br>
Trademark and brand licensing<br>
Main article: Brand licensing<br>A licensor may grant permission to a licensee to distribute products under a trademark. With such a license, the licensee may use the trademark without fear of a claim of trademark infringement by the licensor. The assignment of a license often depends on specific contractual terms. The most common terms are, that a license is only applicable for a particular geographic region, just for a certain period of time or merely for a stage in the value chain. Moreover, there are different types of fees within the trademark and brand licensing. The first form demands a fee independent of sales and profits, the second type of license fee is dependent on the productivity of the licensee.<br>For example, McDonald's licenses their trademark such as the "Golden Arches" or the "Big Mac", but the licenses gives McDonald's a right to impose strict quality standards to their franchisees as they can take back the right to the trademark if they do not meet McDonald's standards.<br>When a licensor grants permission to a licensee to not only distribute, but manufacture a patented product, it is known as licensed production.<br>
Artwork and character licensing<br>A licensor may grant a permission to a licensee to copy and distribute copyrighted works such as "art" (e.g., Thomas Kinkade's painting Dawn in Los Gato) and characters (e.g., Mickey Mouse). With such license, a licensee need not fear a claim of copyright infringement brought by the copyright owner.<br>Artistic license is, however, not related to the aforementioned license. It is a euphemism that denotes freedom of expression, the ability to make the subject appear more engaging or attractive, by fictionalizing part of the subject.<br>
Academia<br>National examples of the licentiate are listed at licentiate (degree)
Copy<br>A licentiate is an academic degree that traditionally conferred the license to teach at a university or to practice a particular profession. The term survived despite the fact that nowadays a doctorate is typically needed in order to teach at a university. The term is also used for a person who holds a licentiate. In English, the degree has never been called a license. In France, the licence is the first degree awarded in Universities.<br>In Sweden, Finland, and in some other European university systems, a 'licentiate' is a postgraduate degree between the master's degree and the doctorate. The licentiate is a popular choice in those countries where a full doctoral degree would take five or more years to achieve. <br>Types of Licenses:<br>

 <br>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.<br>A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power <a data-href="the Internet" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/Internet/the Internet.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Internet</a>, which links billions of other computers and users.<br>Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.<br>Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, together with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved. ]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/computer.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/computer.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 02:15:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[100 Rabbits]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Hundred Rabbits is a small artist collective. Together, we explore the planned failability of modern technology at the bounds of the hyper-connected world. We research and test low-tech solutions and document our findings with the hope of building a more resilient future.<br>We live and work on a 10 meter vessel called pino, we have sailed around the Pacific Ocean and realized how fragile the modern-day computing stack was. Living in remote uninhabited parts of the world has offered us a playground to learn how technology degrades beyond the shores of the western world.<br>Read more about our philosophy and mission.

We made art toys, jewelry, apparel and sold tickets to Chiptune events in Montreal.<br><br>Rek(they/them, or iel) is a writer and cartoonist, Devine(they) is a programmer, artist and musician.<br><br>Back in 2016 when first operating on a sailboat, we experienced frequent failures with both software &amp; hardware, largely due to our small energy storage and lack of reliable connectivity. The solution was to create tools that would be better suited to the limits of our situation. The objective was to replace the bloated, closed-source or subscription software that we were using to do creative work, such as Photoshop, Xcode and Ableton. We were somewhat familiar with web technologies, so we decided to build our programs on this new up and coming framework called Electron.<br>While solving some of our issues, Electron was rapidly increasing in size and soon joined the rest of the software that we wanted to do away with. Our focus shifted toward reducing our energy use, and to ensure reliability we began removing dependencies.<br>To transition toward our new goals, we developed offline web versions as temporary stand-ins while researching ways to build more resilient software. We eventually ported our tools to C, but while we had achieved ideal energy usage, portability was still an issue, so we kept looking. We learnt 6502 assembly, seeing players run our NES game on all these different platforms gave us a new idea.<br>And so, in 2021 we began designing a small virtual machine with a focus on implementability; meaning that moving forward, the applications themselves will no longer need to be ported. Instead, to make any one program available on a new platform, the emulator is the only piece of code that will need to be modified, which is explicitly designed to be easily implemented.<br>This is where we are now. uxn may solve our cross-platform issues, while being extremely light. It took us a long while to get here, we hope that one day the Uxn versions of our software replace the desktop and web versions [16.05.21].<br>Go slow, and fix things.<br><br>From 2012 to 2014, we lived in Japan. Rek was working in an animation studio, and Devine, in a software company. On weekends and evenings, we worked on our first two games: hiversaires &amp; oquonie. Originally from Québec, we were traveling back and forth between Canada and Japan often. We wanted to exit the wasteful loop of acquiring the necessities of life each time our lives were uprooted.<br>We had heard of people living on sailboats but neither of us had even stepped foot on one, nevertheless, we soon found ourselves watching the videos of David Wellsford, Teresa Carey and Nike Steiger, and became obsessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that traveling was a good catalyst for learning new languages, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity, and creativity.<br>In January 2016, we left the cold of Montréal and moved west to British Columbia, where we purchased pino. Our curiosity soon led us to make our first trip out to sea, which escalated into a circumnavigation of the Pacific Ocean.<br>Our life at sea changed how we work, and how we think. We've always made art, and always will, but now we are working on ways to keep doing that sustainably, which translates to making lean and open software that are backward-compatible.<br>A boat, for all its complexity, is in fact a version of simplicity, but of a satisfyingly complex kind. - Adam Nicolson<br><br>Pino's current location: victoria, BC, Canada.<br>View a map of our Pacific circumnavigation, in which we sailed to the us west coast, mexico, french polynesia, cook islands, niue, tonga, new zealand, fiji, The marshall islands, japan and western canada.<br><br>This wiki is statically generated from a small C89 program.<br><br>We carry many devices onboard, some for everyday tasks, while others are reserved for low-power situations.<br>In 2016, we moved aboard Pino with two MacbookPro 2012s. One of them died in Mexico in late 2016 (see tools ecosystem for details). A friend gave us a used MacbookPro 17", but it was too power-hungy for the boat, and it later died in 2020 during our passage from Japan to Canada across the north pacific ocean(a giant jar of umeshu exploded over it).<br>Most of our computers are secondhand, donated to the studio between 2017 and now. We'd like to thank the following people: Josh Auget for the x250Thinkpad, John Eternal for the MacbookPro 13" 2010, Brian Crabtree for the Pinebook, and Lloyd Williams for the MacbookAir 2013 11".<br>Main work stations:<br>
<br>Rek: Macbook Air 2013 running Manjaro
<br>Dev: x250Thinkpad running Manjaro
<br>Current issues:<br>Macbook Air 2013 awaiting keyboard replacement (we have the part).<br>In August 2023, the Pinebook(Manjaro) developed a weird keyboard error, making it impossible to input a password to log in, and then it stopped booting. We'll try to fix it later when in port. The MacbookPro 2012 also stopped booting, not sure why. We'll test it later when we have access to AC (may be battery related).<br>Other work stations:<br>

It's a living document that outlines where we've been, and a tool that advises where we could go.<br>Rek is the steward of this wiki, and authors most of its write-ups and articles(unless stated otherwise). Devine proofreads Rek's writing, and appends to the documentation of our projects regularly. <br>In all that is shared on the many pages populating this wiki, we reserve the right to be wrong, and to change our minds. We are always learning, and deepening our view and understanding of any one thing.<br>Videos. Between 2016 and 2020, we filmed our travels. We filmed regularly, but kept many experiences to ourselves, wishing to be present during worthwhile moments instead of hiding behind a lens. At the end of each month, we would watch our footage and write a summary of that month's events. We planned the monthly videos ahead, and we would gather footage based on what we needed. While one was busy recording the narration, the other would write music. We had our respective tasks when it came time to edit, but both of us took part in the filming.<br>In rough weather, we prioritize our own safety above all, and so we rarely had footage of rough seas.<br>What we use to film and edit our videos:<br>

<br>People choose to live off-grid for self-sufficiency, resilience, or ecological reasons. For us, to live off-grid, is mostly letting go of the numbing culture of convenience and surrounding ourselves with systems we trust for long transits across the ocean. When far away from the coasts, we rely on our vessel and what's on it. When something breaks, we must repair it. We found that learning to live in communion with our vessel offered a peace of mind previously unimaginable.<br>Maslow's pyramid of needs positions as the most basic, or most crucial, physiological needs, like water, food, warmth and rest, followed closely with security and safety. Meeting these basic needs, while living offgrid, takes but some planning and time.<br><br>It's easy to forget that water is not inexhaustible when it flows so readily by the turn of the tap. Living on a boat certainly helps to develop a deeper connection to this precious resource. Depending on where you are, you'll have to treat it, catch it, carry it or pay for it.<br>Basic needs are covered with a mere 10 liters of water a day per person. A person needs between 2.7 and 3.7 liters of drinking water each day. When anchored near a port, once a week, we would ferry four bins of 10 liters from shore to the boat. To conserve water, our sink faucet is operated with a foot pump, where each push draws out 60 ml of water, allowing us to measure our usage.<br>On passages, we carry extra Jerrycans of water, enough to sustain two people for a few more weeks than the length of our trip. Having separate bins makes for a more resilient system, if salt gets into one tank, it won't corrupt the entirety of your supplies. A sure way of preventing contamination, is to check all o-rings and tanks for leaks before leaving. We chose not to have a desalinator aboard Pino, and have managed well without it. It's a device that is expensive, high maintenance and power-hungry.<br>Related: water storage, water filtration &amp; rain.<br><br>Rain catchment is a good way to top-up your tanks. Some sailors set up tarps to catch and lead the water into Jerrycans, others have the water flow directly into their main tank — we don't recommend doing that unless you've got a good filtration system. When it rains, we collect water trickling down from our aft solar panel, or from our inverted cockpit tent (see below picture, see pictures of our boom tent), into bowls or directly into Jerry cans. We collected this extra water for showers, laundry and washing dishes.<br>While the rain itself might be safe to drink, it carries dirt or whatever may be on your tarp, or deck. And depending on where you are, the rain may have environmental pollutants mixed in. For these reasons, I recommend using rainwater for purposes other than drinking and cooking. If you are to drink it, it's important to boil it first for at least 1 minute, or to run it through a good filter. See water filtration.<br>Even if you don't plan on drinking it, it's a good idea to treat the water you catch. Before treating, make sure to filter debris out of the water.<br>Filtering debris. If you don't have a good filter to remove debris/impurities, run the water through a coffee filter. We like to put a funnel over a large container, and to line it with a coffee filter. The filter will eventually get saturated (especially if the water is dirty), and the flow of water will slow down, it may be necessary to replace the filter.<br>Adding bleach to water. Adding bleach is a reliable water treatment method. This is something we've done, and continue to do. The suggested ratio of chlorine to water is 2 drops bleach for 1.14 liters (1 quart). Use a dropper for more precision. The above ratios are for bleach containing 5.25% Sodium Hypochlorite. This amount depends on the concentration, the ratios will be different for 5.25% than for 8% chlorine bleach (1 drop: 1.14 l). Only use regular, unscented chlorine bleach products that are suitable for disinfection and sanitization, as indicated on the label. Allow the treated water to stand for 30 minutes. A good way to remember these ratios, is this saying:<br>“You must be 21 to drink”.<br>Things to remember:<br>
<br>Use fresh liquid bleach (less than 1 year old).
<br>Bleach doesn't remove chemical pollutants or disease-causing organisms (but in an emergency, if there is no way to boil it, it is better than nothing).
<br>Use a dropper for more precision when adding bleach.
<br><br>If we have a tap near the boat that permits the use of a hose, we hook a twin set of filter housings in the line to purify the water. The 1st stage filter is pleated, and removes sediment, silt, dirt, rust, and other particles, and the 2nd stage carbon filter reduce the content of chlorine, concentration of toxic heavy metals, natural organic matter and oil products.<br>When we don't have access to pressured water, we filter the water by gravity (see our gravity water filter). We carry a pair of black Berkey purification element filters, a cost-effective way to remove chlorine (inc. chloramines), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, VOCs, parasites, viruses, pathogenic bacteria, herbicides/pesticides, and hundreds of other contaminants from the water without removing the beneficial minerals, and without the use of any electricity.<br>Each element is designed to purify approximately 3,000 gallons of water before needing replacement, so they last a long, long time. We built our own filter holder (above photo), and strain contaminants in the water by gravity (a container over a bucket, with the purification elements in the top bucket, transfering clean water to the bottom bucket. Bottom bucket ought to have spigot).<br>For low-tech options, check out this ceramic filter, or the 3 bucket water filtration system. We aimed for the most compact, and practical system possible, even if it isn't the cheapest.<br><br>Coastal locations like marinas and public beaches often have fresh water showers for local swimmers or marina guests. Usually free, or available for use at a nominal fee (1-2$ for 5 minutes). Most times these showers operate on a timer. We don't have a shower system on pino, the space doesn't allow for it and besides, we think it would use up too much water when at anchor.<br>In the summer, or when in warm places, we use a pressurized sprayer as a shower. It uses little water and can be found in most hardware stores (don't buy a used one, there may be lingering chemicals). During our north pacific ocean crossing, we use the pressure sprayer to wash dishes to further save on water. When showering on the boat we don't use soap. When water is scarce, we bathe in salt water, and rinse with fresh water.<br>In the winter, if we have no land access we heat up water on the stove and clean ourselves with a bucket and rag. We don't shower daily, maybe twice a week (depending on activity level).<br><br>Halving requirements is the same as doubling capacity.<br>
— Nigel Calder<br>There are working alternatives to most powered devices on a boat. Keeping consumptions low reduces the need for extra solar, keeping costs down and reducing the amount of things that can break, or fail.<br>To measure current power usage, make a list of indispensable electric systems and their energy requirements, including lighting, appliances, laptops etc. Look up their power usage in watts, for example, a Macbook Pro (models vary) might draw 60 W when in use. If in use for 6 consecutive hours, it would draw roughly 360 Wh per day. Wattage varies depending on the task performed on the computer, for instance video editing is more resource intensive than writing. The type of computer you have affects the amount of energy consumption overall, and the more external hardware you connect to it the more power it will consume. Adding up the wattage will give a rough estimate of daily use. Batteries have an amp-hour rating that can help calculate the energy available to you, to learn more about this read about batteries.<br>The energy coming from solar panels fluctuates based on the angle of the sun, cloud coverage and other obstructions. Power usage aboard varies a lot from day to day, depending on what task is done that day. While on passage, our own capability to capture sunlight is reduced to keep our windage low, but our energy consumption is equally reduced for not much else is drawing power than our navigation electronics like the AIS, the wind meter, and at night, the lights.<br>An anchored board will orbit its anchor according to the wind, and rarely stays in the same spot and so it is difficult to position panels to guarantee an optimal draw. On cloudless days the mast may cast a shadow covering a large part of the panels. On moments such as this, or cloudy days, it is best to adapt by using appliances less, and to learn to live according to the weather.<br>A people can be just as dangerously overpowered by the wattage of its tools as by the caloric content of its foods, but it is much harder to confess to a national overindulgence in wattage than to a sickening diet.<br>
— Ivan Illich<br>For each 100 people telling us to "just install more solar panels", only 1 person will consider ways to reduce power usage. Instead of scaling our battery banks to our needs, we chose to adapt our needs to the available space for batteries and surface for panels. It's also important to consider that more solar panels often mean more windage. Having a complex system exposed to a harsh environment like the sea, creates opportunities for things to break. Saltwater corrosion is a very real threat. Nowadays, many electronics, or 'smart' systems, use proprietary parts, making them difficult to repair. We've encountered many boats, stuck in port for weeks and weeks, waiting for parts to arrive. An over-reliance on convenience products may bind you to services on land, in a way that you may not want.<br>Related: solar setup, energy &amp; solar tips<br><br>Most city-centers will have a hospital. Ones out in the islands—South Pacific for instance—tend to be good and cheap, but in most cases you must be self-sufficient. That includes a well-stocked medical supply, and the know-how to fix yourself up.<br>Before going offshore, if you can, we recommend doing a first-aid course. Knowing what to do in the event of severe bleeding, choking, or severe allergic reactions, could save your crew's life.<br>In a marine environment, it may not be possible for EMS personnel to come to your assistance in an emergency. You may need to contact a doctor and request advice on providing care, even if it is outside of your training. Read about calling for help on a boat. Document the doctor’s orders carefully.<br>You should prepare the following information and present it to the doctor:<br>
<br>Routine information about the ship
<br>Routine information about the person
<br>Details of the illness/injury
<br>Care rendered and the person’s response to that care
<br>MALARIA<br>If travelling into Malaria endemic areas, we carry rapid diagnostic tests. The test is 90% accurate and quickly diagnoses if Malaria is present, and if so, which one you have, so that treatment can commence quickly if needed. We relied on tests because we were close to hospitals, but if traveling to islands with no facilities it might be a good idea to also carry antimalarials (e.g., malarone).<br>For medicine like Malarone, it's important to start this medication 1-2 days before you enter the malarious area, to continue while in the area and for 7 days after leaving.<br>The best protection is prevention. Use screens on windows and doors, if you must go out in the evening or after a big rain wear long-sleeved shirts and pants and wear insect repellents that contain diethyltoluamide (DEET).<br>Malaria symptoms: fever, chills, headache, other flu-like symptoms.<br>See malaria information by country.<br>JELLYFISH STINGS<br>Stings from marine life can range from painful, to life-threatening.<br>If stung by a jellyfish:<br>
<br>Flush the injured area with vinegar for at least 30 seconds, if vinegar isn't available mix baking soda and water into a paste and apply it to the area for 20 minutes.
<br>Remove any pieces of the animal, while protecting your hands,
<br>Immerse the affected area in water as hot as the person can tolerate for at least 20 minutes, or until the person feels less pain
<br>Seek medical attention if there is an infection, or if the person has trouble breathing. Always flush with vinegar FIRST, before removing any part of the animal, the tentacles can continue to fire even after they're detached so you must neutralize the poison before touching them or they could inject more poison into the person.<br>SUNBURNS<br>The following precautions will help prevent sunburns:<br>
<br>Limit sun exposure between 1000-1500, if possible.
<br>Wear light colored clothing that covers the arms, neck and legs.
<br>Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and apply it 15-30 minutes before going outdoors. Reapply sunscreen at least every 2 hours, as well as after being in the water and after sweating.
<br>Take a cool shower to relieve pain. Treat mild to moderate sunburns with aloe vera gel. Apply it a few times a day to the sunburnt area.<br>If you have blisters, leave them. The liquid in the blisters will ensure that the skin heals well, while protecting it from infection. While the sunburn is healing, stay out of the sun, and keep the area covered if outside.<br>HYPOTHERMIA<br>There are four levels of hypothermia, from mild to severe life-threatening symptoms:<br>
<br>Cold stressed, not hypothermic: conscious, normal movement, shivering, and alert.
<br>Mild hypothermia: conscious, impaired movement, shivering, alert
<br>Moderate hypothermia: conscious, impaired movement, little or no shivering, not alert
<br>Severe hypothermia: cold, unconscious.
<br>Hypothermia happens faster in cold water than cold air. Cold-water immersion has four distinct phases:<br>
<br>Cold-Shock Response: Rapid cooling of the skin causes a gasp followed by hyperventilation (lasting 1-2 min).
<br>Cold Incapacitation: Further cooling of nerve and muscle fibres causes weakness and a loss of coordination, leading to incapacitation within approximately 15 minutes.
<br>Hypothermia: A person dressed appropriately for the weather conditions will take 30 minutes + to become mildly hypothermic.
<br>Circum-Rescue Collapse: Can occur just prior to, during, or after rescue. The signs and symptoms range from collapsing, to fainting, to cardiac arrest. When rescuing a person from cold water, monitor the person’s condition carefully and be prepared to provide emergency care.
<br>If you are in OPEN WATER you can increase your survival time while waiting for rescue by doing the following:<br>
<br>
With a PFD, adopt the Heat Escape Lessening Position (HELP):

<br>
Press your arms against your armpits.

<br>
Place your forearms across your chest.

<br>
Squeeze your thighs together and raise your knees toward your chest.

<br>
If several people are in the water together, adopt the huddle position:

<br>
Face each other

<br>
Have each person squeeze their thighs together

<br>
Form a circle and hug each other. Each person should place one arm above and one arm below the arms of those adjacent, and pull the sides of the chests together

<br>
Sandwich any children or persons without a PFD inside the huddle.

<br>
Get out of the water as much as possible by using a capsized boat or other floating object as a flotation device.

<br>Caring for hypothermia<br>Care for hypothermia varies depending on the severity of the symptoms mentioned earlier (cold stressed/not hypothermic, mild hypothermia, moderate hypothermia and severe hypothermia):<br>
<br>
Cold stressed, not hypothermic

<br>
Reduce heat loss, add dry clothing.

<br>
Give high-calorie food or drink (warm, sugary, non-alcoholic)

<br>
Increase heat production (exercise, e.g., run in place)

<br>
Mild hypothermia

<br>
Handle person gently, keep horizontal

<br>
No standing/walking for at least 30 min

<br>
Insulate the person/vapor barrier (hypothermia wrap, see below)

<br>
Give high-calorie food or drink (warm, sugary, non-alcoholic)

<br>
Monitor until improvement for 30 min

<br>
Moderate hypothermia

<br>
Handle person gently, keep horizontal

<br>
No standing/walking

<br>
Insulate the person/vapor barrier (hypothermia wrap, see below)

<br>
No drink or food

<br>
Apply heat to upper torso, by applying warm water bottles, or heating pads (i.e., the armpits, chest, and upper back). Body heat from yourself can also work in an emergency

<br>
Severe hypothermia

<br>
Treat as moderate hypothermia

<br>
If no obvious vital signs, do 60-second breathing check

<br>
If not breathing, start CPR

<br>HYPOTHERMIA WRAP<br>Applying a hypothermia wrap, or hypothermia 'burrito', is an excellent way to reduce the heat lost by a person with hypothermia.<br>It consists of layering insulation and heat-reflecting material. If help is more than 30 minutes away (common on offshore boats), protect the person from the environment, remove the wet clothing and put them in a hypothermia wrap.<br>To apply a hypothermia wrap:<br>
<br>Insulation pad. Place it between the person and the ground/floor.
<br>Sleeping bag/blanket. Wrap the person, apply as much insulation as possible.
<br>Hat or hood. Cover person's head/neck with a toque, heavy hat, or hood.
<br>Vapour barrier. If the person is dry, place the vapour barrier outside of the insulation wrap. If the person is wet, place the vapour barrier inside the insulation wrap. If two vapour barriers are available, place one inside and one outside the insulation wrap. A vapour barrier can be a plastic tarp or foil blanket.
<br>DAN BOATER<br>In case of a serious injury, you must have the means to get yourself to the nearest clinic. We use DAN Boater, a repatriation insurance that covers helicopter/transportation fees.<br>MEDICAL RESOURCES<br>We find that medical apps for mobiles, and FM army field manuals, are helpful when dealing with minor burns, cuts and various aches. If you have a smart phone, the Canadian Red Cross app is free, works offline, and is very good.<br>We also recommend:<br>

<br><br>Internet access is the woe of any working nomad. internet is sometimes spotty, and data in some countries is slow, expensive, or limited to small blocks at a time. While circumnavigating the Pacific, we amassed sim cards, pocket WiFis, and have often used connections from businesses on land. Overtime, we found ways to lessen our dependence on the internet, and to save on bandwidth.<br>With limited access, it is important to use online time wisely. Prior to connecting we make a list of tasks that we must do, such as pushing updates and making backups of our data online. When searching for help online, we disable javascript and use lightweight search engines, such as ddg.gg/lite. When checking social media, we disable auto-playing videos and image previews to save bandwidth.<br>When we have a reliable internet connection, we gather copies of all the online material we will need. We keep offline versions of entire websites, writing guides, articles and even whole sections of Wikipedia (using wget) If we find ourselves without a connection, we can still solve our problems by using our offline mirrors. By the way, you can download our entire website.<br>To reduce your bandwidth usage and battery drainage, install NoScript, and uBlock on your browser; or use a text-only browser like Lynx.<br>We research our destinations ahead of time to make sure we’ll have a reliable connection when we need it. This means we’ll be spending less time in secluded areas, and more time in city centers near a cell tower or WiFi signal. With some planning it is possible to have both paradise and connectivity, we found such a place in Huahine (see internet in paradise) in french polynesia, and again in fiji. Internet access will only get better as far-flung island nations gain purchasing power.<br><br>Passports are a global requirement for international travel, but their value varies depending on the holder’s country of origin. Passport privilege means that a Japanese national will have free roam over all continents, while someone from Afghanistan will likely be barred entry outright. Inequalities related to passport privilege means that many will face discrimination, and will be forced through a tiresome process of applying for a visa—all of which costs money, time, and energy. It is not fair. Everyone should be granted the same rights, but wishing things to be different does little to alter reality. The best thing to do is to stay informed, and to be ready.<br>It is important to read about the formalities of each country before visiting, because applying for visas can take a lot of time. Some countries may grant a visa on arrival to certain passport holders, but never assume this, do your research.<br>Customs in certain countries (like new zealand or fiji) sometimes require an Advance Notice of Arrival. A failure to send this document before arriving might result in hefty fees. Most countries have designated ports of entry for visiting yachts, usually a port with a customs, immigration and quarantine office.<br>Upon arriving in the country, fly your yellow quarantine flag (we just hang a yellow cloth with clothes pins, see above picture hehe) and proceed to the quarantine anchorage, or dock. In some cases, you might have to hail the Port Authority on VHF to announce your arrival. They will not allow you to touch land until you're properly checked in. Countries like New Zealand and Australia demand that your vessel's bottom be clean (they will require proof), to avoid introducing invasive species into its home waters.<br>Some countries will give visa extensions, but plan appropriately and apply long before it is set to expire. If your boat needs repairs, or cannot leave due to weather, you may be allowed a short extension (for a price).<br>Upon entry or departure, you may need to pay the immigration, customs, health and quarantine officers. These fees are documented, it is best to learn what prices to expect before arriving. We find Noonsite to be a good up-to-date ressource for country-specific information on fees, customs or quarantine procedures.<br><br>Not all places have ATMs, but always have a bank nearby that will take a VISA card. In the islands we prefer to pay in cash, a lot of places, like fresh food markets, don't accept credit anyway.<br>Better make sure that your credit card will not be blocked when used in foreign countries, and that it will expire at a location that will allow for you to receive a new one.<br><br>In our galley, we use LPG (Liquefied petroleum gas) to cook by way of a gimballed stove. While not an ideal fuel, there are few alternatives for sailboats.<br>The stove is fueled by a 9 kg (20 lbs) with a backup 5 kg (11 lbs) tank. pino houses two tanks with only one tank connected at a time, this way we can get a tank filled while the other is still in use. One 5 kg tank can last us two months, and less if we bake a lot, and a 9kg (20 lbs) tank which can last us 4-5 months.<br>Many countries don't want to refill foreign tanks, especially if they have an aged appearance. Throughout our travels we had to give up 3 tanks, 1 in New Zealand and 2 in Japan.<br>Our main tank lives in its own locker aft of the boat, with a drain hose leading down and off the stern. In the event of a leak, the gas will escape from this hose rather than filling the compartment and slipping down into the bilge. Our boat has a solenoid valve with a gas shut off that we can operate from inside the cabin, it is fitted with a sniffer and alarm to detect leaks. For safety, solenoids close in the event of a power failure. An LPG tank should never be stored inside. We store our secondary tank off the aft rail on a little platform we built.<br>Tank compability. In 2022, we switched out all of the old components of our propane system (regulator, solenoid, pressure gauge and hoses) because they were thoroughly rusted (solenoid and pressure gauge, especially). The pigtail that connects to the propane tank though is different, and screws onto the mouth of the valve from the outside, rather than from the inside, unlike our older connector. Our Japanese tanks can only take an inside connection. Be mindful of this when changing systems, industry standards change.<br>Tank swaps. Many countries use a 'tank swap' system. You bring your tank when it is finished and swap it with another. This is a good system because the tanks are often made of painted steel and can corrode over time, especially if exposed to salt air. When swapped at a store, the steel tanks are re-painted and checked for problems, eliminating the need to do those checks yourself.<br>Keeping your own propane tank. If you prefer to have your own tank, a good alternative are aluminum or fibreglass tanks—although many places won't want to fill fibreglass tanks. If using your own tank for a while, you might run into issues with an overfilled tank (it happened to us). When exposed to the sun on a hot day (if the tank is outside), the gas inside of the tank expands and will open the pressure release valve. Some LPG will escape from the valve to relieve the pressure in the tank. Don't handle the tank as it is off gassing. If the smell bothers you, pour some cold water over the tank to help it cool faster. The pressure release valve will close when the pressure has lessened, but may not with a faulty tank. To check for leaks on your tank, pour some soapy water over the tank. Bubbles will form around the leak.<br>In 2022, we replaced all of the parts of our LPG system. For more information see lpg refit.<br><br>When anchoring, it can be difficult to stay focused. The weather decides everything. It determines whether or not we can work. If the weather is foul, we are on anchor-watch to make sure we don't drag.<br>Waves also make it hard to do simple tasks like writing, or drawing. Depending on the direction of the wind, we need to move the boat and that too, takes focus and time away from work. Calm and sunny days are distracting in other ways: when the water is clear and teeming with colourful fish, it is difficult to resist jumping off. All in all though, we welcome these interruptions, as it ensures we take enough work breaks.<br><br>While modern grocery stores can be found in larger cities, these can often be far apart. In smaller towns, fresh vegetable and fruit markets are seldom open everyday, most only once a week. We picked up the habit of buying food in large quantities.<br>Aboard Pino, we have no refrigeration (read our notes). Canned, dried or shelf-stable foods are a good alternative to this.<br>Canned foods: Canning doesn't preserve many nutrients in food, but in a bind in can be a useful way to carry food, although cans can rust through overtime (we've had this happen). We remove tags so they don't draw moisture, and label the cans with a marker pen. Our favorite canned foods are: tomato paste, artichokes, jackfruit, maple syrup(!!!), black olives, corn niblets and chipotle peppers. Buy an assortment of cans, find ones which suit your tastes. We usually look for cans without added salt or sweeteners.<br>Dry foods: Dry food will keep for a long, long time on ocean passages. We keep a variety of dried grains, but also dried vegetables since we don't have refrigeration. Dried veg keep well in air-tight containers, their nutrients are preserved, and add variety to dishes. We add dry vegetables to boiling pasta to re-hydrate them. Dry mushrooms like shiitake, and kombu(algae) are a great base for broth. Our favorite dry foods are nori, kombu, dried tomatoes, raisins, dates, TVP(textured vegetable protein), shitake, dry tofu, rice cakes, radish etc. We stock many types of whole grains (buckwheat, whole wheat, cornmeal, oats). Different grains offer different nutritional profiles, and meal options. To read more about how we store food, see food storage.<br>We like to buy flour in bulk. We keep it in separate jars (each accommodating a 2 kg bag). Keeping some types of flour separate helps to avoid problems, like weevils. If one batch is contaminated, the other might be fine. Keeping the whole grain version of those flours, like wheat berries, is even better because they last longer, but then it might be necessary to carry a grain mill (see our grinder).<br>Shelf-stable foods: Shelf stable food kept in tetra-paks are useful to keep perishable goods. Our favorites include tofu and plant milks.<br>Provisioning can be expensive in certain countries, so stocking strategically with cheaper stores, ahead of time, can help to save money. If you're shopping and you see something you like at a good price, buy tons of it, chances are you won't be seeing it again on your next visit (turn-arounds are quick in some stores, and won't re-stock the same items again).<br>Preserving food, via lactofermentation, or canning, is essential when traveling on a budget. A pressure cooker and glass jars will save you money and will help reduce waste. Preparing your own stores, also means that you choose what goes in it, therefore reducing your intake of added salts and sugars.<br><br>Our work schedule is tied to the weather, as we depend on solar energy to power our computers. By looking at the forecast, we can determine when we will get the most work done: consecutive days of sun grant us enough power for video editing, while overcast days are reserved for low-power work, like writing, coding and planning.<br>In the constraints of expensive cell phone data, uploading large files can be made possible by offloading heavy-lifting onto remote servers; having your server build and upload your projects instead of using your laptop batteries and broadband.<br>There is no solution to uploading videos to YouTube, it's a costly and lengthy process. When we make videos, we keep them under 5 minutes to help reduce upload time.<br>We work less, by keeping our needs small. We both cannot deal with working within rigid schedules, and we both know that we find our best selves when working close to nature.<br><br>Onboard Pino we carry a fixed marine VHF radio, a handheld VHF and two transceiver Walkie Talkie two-way radios. VHF/UHF radio waves travel in straight lines (line-of-sight) generally cannot travel beyond the horizon. VHF (very high frequency) is the designation for the range of radio frequencies from 30 to 300 megahertz (MHz)<br>A marine VHF radio is an important and reliable for bidirectional voice communication both for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore. In Canada, a Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permit is required to transmit, it is unlawful to operate a ship station that is not licensed. The handheld marine VHF has the same functionalities as the fixed version, but is equipped with DSC(Digital Select Calling).<br>We sometimes use the two transceiver two-way radios to talk to each other from shore-to-shore, an Amateur Radio License is required to broadcast with this type of radio in Canada. A license ensures that new users are aware of the existing regulations and don't broadcast on reserved frequencies.<br><br>We carry many devices onboard, some for everyday tasks, while others are reserved for low-power situations.<br>In 2016, we moved aboard Pino with two MacbookPro 2012s. One of them died in Mexico in late 2016 (see tools ecosystem for details). A friend gave us a used MacbookPro 17", but it was too power-hungy for the boat, and it later died in 2020 during our passage from Japan to Canada across the north pacific ocean(a giant jar of umeshu exploded over it).<br>Most of our computers are secondhand, donated to the studio between 2017 and now. We'd like to thank the following people: Josh Auget for the x250Thinkpad, John Eternal for the MacbookPro 13" 2010, Brian Crabtree for the Pinebook, and Lloyd Williams for the MacbookAir 2013 11".<br>Main work stations:<br>
<br>Rek: Macbook Air 2013 running Manjaro
<br>Dev: x250Thinkpad running Manjaro
<br>Current issues:<br>Macbook Air 2013 awaiting keyboard replacement (we have the part).<br>In August 2023, the Pinebook(Manjaro) developed a weird keyboard error, making it impossible to input a password to log in, and then it stopped booting. We'll try to fix it later when in port. The MacbookPro 2012 also stopped booting, not sure why. We'll test it later when we have access to AC (may be battery related).<br>Note: We are always looking for backup used laptops, if you can help us on that front, let us know at hundredrabbits at gmail dot com.<br>Other work stations:<br>
<br>MacbookPro 2010 running Manjaro<br>
(changed battery, for the third time, bit too power demanding to use at anchor)
<br>ChromeBook running ChromeOS<br>
(working, low-power, but doesn't permit the use of Uxn tools, can barely run Gimp)
<br><br>Computers are subject to water intrusion and saltwater corrosion, but with some care they can survive in a normal marine environment. We solved most of the problems by cleaning external connections often, and by storing them in a sealed box with some desiccants after each use. The main issue with computers on boats is that it is difficult to source parts when they break. To make matters worse, many modern machines have non-replaceable batteries, proprietary storage, and soldered-in RAM. The parts that fail the most are power connectors, external connections and batteries.<br>Leaving a port with spare parts is a good tactic, but leaving with backup PCs is even better. There are many good inexpensive computers on the market, like notebook processors (Pinebook, EeeBook) and single-board computers (Pine64). These computers run on lower voltage, which lower overall power consumption. By consuming less power, the system will be less expensive to run, but more importantly, it will run much longer on existing battery technology.<br>Carrying a spare battery isn't a great idea as you may not use it right away, and that its literal age also affects performance. Computers are rated for a limited number of cycles. If you drain the battery completely and recharge it every day, it'll be spent after 3 years. Keeping a laptop battery fully-charged is important as it draws a lot more power at half-charge, the last few percentage points are much lower wattage to float/top it off. Enabling the various power states in your computer settings can also reduce power consumption, which in turn spares your battery. If available, enable 'eco-mode' or 'low power mode'. We suffered battery failure on multiple laptops, read about it in tools ecosystem.<br>When parts fail on our boat we repair them, and we do the same for our PCs. Nowadays it is commonplace to trash a device when it stops working, contributing to the growing problem of e-waste in the world. Replacing broken components is important, as manufacturing a new PC makes a far bigger ecological footprint than manufacturing a new replacement part. If you must get a new PC, look for product longevity, including upgradability, repairability and modularity. In today's climate, making electronics last longer is crucial.<br><br>Software has a big impact on productivity, they need to be reliable and fast. Those that require heavy updates, that have a high CPU usage and that need frequent connectivity to function are problematic for us. Much of the software on the market is designed by people living on the grid with unlimited access to internet. Tools locking up at sea, asking for a connection to continue working don't float on a boat. Adobe products are a good example, as they require an internet connection periodically for subscription validation. If away from big cities, you may open your computer in an atoll to find that you no longer have access to the tool you need to get things done. Choosing a tool that doesn't require a subscription is essential for working nomads that don't have a reliable connection.<br>Have a look at cpulimit to learn how to throttle running software and control the battery drainage rate.<br>In our first year, we struggled to download 10gb software updates on slow Polynesian internet. Processor-intensive software or apps is a strain on limited power and bandwidth, but it doesn't have to be that way. The way developers write them can affect the power consumption of the resulting product. Chat rooms and bare bones text editors aren't supposed to be process-heavy, and yet the popular communication platform Slack requires outrageous amounts of ram and CPU to function. This is because Slack is embedding the entirety of Google Chrome in their app. Making software this way is costly to off-grid users, or those on slow connections, but luckily there are many alternatives. See TinyTools and Bloatware Alternatives.<br>Our computer batteries should not need to grow ever larger only to support these bloatwares, nor should we need to add extra solar to power them. Just as you would look at the nutritional content of food products at the grocery store, find out how much energy your apps are consuming.<br><br>Hardware failure is common on boats due to the hostile environment. Saltwater is the kryptonite of electronics. This is why it is important to backup data often to avoid losing work. There are advantages and disadvantages with all methods of data storage, but I’ll outline the most useful ones:<br>Cloud storage: For a fee, you can back up your data online and sync files from your desktop. This method doesn’t eliminate physical storage as data can’t be synced to the cloud without a connection. Offloading data storage to a centralized service is problematic in other ways, because services have rules and owners and processes which can complicate things. For instance, country politics have made it so that Google restricts access to some of its business services in certain countries or regions, such as China, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. Whatever data you have stored with Google Drive, if traveling to any of these countries will not be accessible. As conflicts arise, more countries can end up on that list. We keep documents we don’t need regular access to on the cloud, with copies on hard disks.<br>Hard copies. Paper is evidently a stable and widely accessible material, unlike digital devices which are subject to breakages and obsolescence. There's a good reason books and other documents from centuries ago are still readable today. We like to keep printed copies of websites and other online reference materials, such as grammar guides for writing, or language manuals for coding. Our to-do lists and calendars are also on paper. Keeping data like this means we always have access and aren't limited to our computer's battery. We protect hard copies from moisture and rot, we keep documents in plastic sleeves, or sealed up in plastic boxes.<br>External hard drives: A hard drive is the best balance of practical and reliable storage. However, hard drives are rated for a limited number of read/write cycles, and can be expected to fail eventually. To prevent data loss due to HD failure, it’s a good idea to store the same data across multiple hard drives.<br>Offline databases: Keeping an offline collection of websites on computers or HD ensures constant access, and reduces the energy associated with re-loading them repeatedly. It’s possible to save web pages with most browsers by selecting File &gt; Save Page As. To access the page offline, click on the HTML file. Another option is to mirror entire web sites using command-line tools. We keep offline databases full of notes on a variety of subjects to refer to when there’s no internet.<br>For those who need a vast quantity of reference materials, it's possible to setup an internet in the box on your boat. In short, it permits you to browse through the World’s Free Knowledge (Wikipedia, Khan Academy, OpenStreetMap, E-Books and many others) while offline. You can install an internet-in-a-box using very diverse hardware, like on a Raspberry Pi or on a terabyte HD with a built-in hotspot. This system was originally designed for students with restricted internet access and people in remote areas of the world not served by broadband. You can buy one, or better yet create a digital library filled with content tailored to your needs. This might be especially useful for sailors who homeschool.<br>Keeping files on the cloud, on hard drives and hard copies gives our floating studio the redundancy required to ensure reliability.<br><br>Cruising in cold places means that you need a reliable way to heat your boat. A system that uses no, or little power is preferable.<br>Carbon Monoxide. With heating in small spaces a C0 detector is essential, as is good air circulation. Always keep a hatch open so the air can keep moving, with proper ventilation, the gas is carried harmlessly away. Carbon monoxide binds to the red blood cells 200 times better than oxygen. As carbon monoxide attaches to red blood cells, it keeps oxygen from properly binding. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be very similar to those of the flu (headache, dizziness/light-headedness, confusion/altered levels of responsiveness, weakness or fatigue, muscle cramps, nausea/vomiting &amp; chest pain). If you suspect C0 poisoning, exit and ventilate the area.<br>Dispersing heat around the space is difficult on a boat, but not impossible. Caframo thermoelectric EcoFans make use of the heat generated by the stove to push air around without using electricity.<br>When talking about space heating, we tend to forget that our own bodies are heating appliances too. The largest part of heat loss occurs via the skin, and wearing sufficient clothing prevents body heat from escaping into the environment. Insulating our bodies is more efficient than insulating the space they're in, requiring only a small layer of air to be heater as opposed to warming all the air in a room to achieve similar results. In winter, thermal clothing is a very smart idea.<br>Before an emergency strikes in the winter, make sure you've got a way to warm your home. For a boat, consider building a copper coil alcohol heater. See instructions here(GoogleDrive document, 2 MB).<br>Below are the heating systems we're most familiar with, having had both aboard pino:<br>Diesel-fired forced hot air heating system: Forced air heaters are fitted with an electrically powered fuel pump, flame ignition device, forced draft combustion chamber and heat exchanger, fuel metering pump, and integrated control unit. Hot air is circulated through the boat via flex tubes to vents. They are compact, fuel efficient and make use of an existing fuel onboard(diesel). The downside is that they are not cheap, they use a lot of power on start-up, and they need to be run often otherwise they will clog up.<br>Solid fuel stove: A solid fuel stove requires space, a chimney on deck, and considerable heat shielding, but is a good option to heat a boat without electricity. A solid fuel stove also doubles as a cook stove, serving as a backup to the main stove. Solid fuel stoves on boats will likely be very small, and will have to be stoked often(esp wood stoves). Another thing to remember, is that you'll need to have space to store wood, or charcoal. Charcoal should be stored away from the stove in a metal, air-tight container. Wood should be kept dry, and cut small to fit into the small firebox. An option to keep wood is pressed wood logs, made entirely of wood byproducts from sawmills. They have long burn times and occupy less space. See our woodstove.<br><br>
<br>Prime the flue on start-up. Light a candle and place it inside the stove near the opening of the flue to help dissipate cold air that may be lingering inside. Cold air in the flue can cause smoke to back flow in. Another good trick is to wad up newspaper tightly, light it, and to aim it inside the opening of the flue.
<br>How to clean glass window of stove. Wetting a bit of newspaper and dipping it in ash is a good trick to remove build-up on glass windows. Moistened brown paper and ash also works.
<br>How to avoid creosote build-up. Buildup is the result of smoldering fires, which produce a lot of smoke because of the lack of oxygen. Wet wood and other types of wood are other culprits. There will be very little creosite if the fire burns hot until all wood is combusted, and if the dampers are turned down, allowing the coals to slowly burn out.
<br>What to do in the event of a chimney fire. If you ever have a chimney fire, put a bunch of wet newspaper in the firebox to smother the fire and also to steam up and smother the flue.
<br>Banking a fire. Banking a fire is an art. The basic idea is to burn the logs from one side. You can do this by coal placement, wood placement, using ash to block off one side, log size and even wood type. The idea is to make the fire burn hot but long by burning from one side only so that it burns well, but slower because it burns from one side of the log to the other instead off all the log at once. (Last three tips courtesy of Kyle P. Cunningham)
<br><br>Waste is always a tricky topic for boaters, because it’s something you’ve got to deal with. Keeping surrounding waters clean and free of contaminants is important. The primary environmental concern with sewage is not the urine, which is somewhat sterile, but feces which contain bacteria, pathogens, and nutrients, and should not go overboard.<br>Human urine and ocean water are mainly water, sodium and chloride ions. One compound found in urine that is not found in the ocean is urea, a carbon-based compound that helps the body rid itself of nitrogen. The nitrogen in urea combines with ocean water to produce ammonium, a compound that acts as food for ocean plant life.<br>Most sailboats have marine heads that use either fresh, or salt water. They can be powered, or make use of manual hand pumps to suck in water to evacuate sewage. Typically, the head is routed through a 3-way valve (Y valve) that can be switched to empty directly overboard by way of a thru-hull, or into a holding tank. A macerator lies between the tank and thru-hull, its job is to break up the sewage into tiny particles.<br>We don't recommend a fresh water head on a boat. Flushing with fresh water accounts for nearly a third of household water consumption, and that doesn't make sense in a small space. All onboard tankage ought to be used for cooking, washing or drinking. Marine heads that use sea water are better, although they will require more maintenance.<br>The word waste doesn’t exist in nature. Waste is not a word fit for the 21st century and the ecological society we’re trying to build. We are the only animal that deliberately mixes water with our own waste. That’s important because you create such a treatment issue to clean that water up. It’s ecological insanity. — Fin Jordão<br>A holding tank may only be emptied, from at least, 3 miles from shore. Pump-out stations will help you get rid of sewage, but are only available near a handful of cities.<br>A dry toilet is a good option for those who do not want to haul anchor and head offshore to flush their tank. A dry toilet separates liquids and solids. Solids are mixed into a medium that will wick up moisture, eliminating smells. Having a dry toilet aboard frees up much-needed space. It also means no holding tank to empty, no smelly hoses to unclog, and little to no maintenance. You can build your own dry toilet or buy one of the many models on the market. On the market most dry toilets are referred to as 'composting heads' despite the fact that they are not designed for true, full composting onboard. Humanure needs 12-24 months to become pathogen free, and few sailboats have the carrying capacity for this. ]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Off Grid/100 Rabbits/Off the Grid.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Natural/Electricity/Off Grid/100 Rabbits/Off the Grid.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 02:15:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Secure Scuttlebutt]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) is a peer-to peer communication protocol, mesh network, and self-hosted social media ecosystem. Each user hosts their own content and the content of the peers they follow, which provides fault tolerance and eventual consistency. Messages are digitally signed and added to an append-only list of messages published by an author. SSB is primarily used for implementing distributed social networks, and utilizes cryptography to assure that content remains unforged as it is propagated through the network.<br>In contrast to the major corporate social media platforms, user data and content on Secure Scuttlebutt is not monetized, there are no software design decisions being made in order to maximize user engagement or boost marketing metrics, and there is no paid advertising. According to Forbes, "Scuttlebutt itself isn't supported by venture capital. Instead ... Scuttlebutt is backed by grants that helped jump-start the process ... [and] there are now hundreds of users who personally donate to the cause and an estimated 30,000 people using one of at least six social networks on the protocol".<br><br>SSB was created by Dominic Tarr in 2014 as part of experimental development in alternative databases and distributed systems. Tarr lived on a sailboat with unreliable internet connection, and became interested in creating an offline-friendly secure gossip protocol for social networking. The word scuttlebutt is slang for "water-cooler gossip" among sailors. SSB gained popularity on the wave of privacy controversies raising against the traditional social media.<br><br>Secure Scuttlebutt operates as a database of immutable append-only feeds, which allows resilient replication over the Internet, local area networks, and sneakernets. Messages are hashed with SHA256 and verified with an Ed25519 signature; this makes it impossible to forge a message without the private key of the author. Users only download messages from peers that they follow (and optionally friends of friends), which prevents harassment and spam. This makes the network invite-only, meaning that new peers who join the network aren't visible until someone follows them.<br>User content in SSB is organized as an append-only sequence of immutable messages, where messages cryptographically sign adjacent messages for the purpose of guaranteeing unforgeabilitity of the sequences as they are replicated to other peers.

 <br>Off-the-grid or off-grid is a characteristic of buildings and a lifestyle designed in an independent manner without reliance on one or more public utilities. The term "off-the-grid" traditionally refers to not being connected to the electrical grid, but can also include other utilities like water, gas, and sewer systems, and can scale from residential homes to small communities. Off-the-grid living allows for buildings and people to be self-sufficient, which is advantageous in isolated locations where normal utilities cannot reach and is attractive to those who want to reduce environmental impact and cost of living. Generally, an off-grid building must be able to supply energy and potable water for itself, as well as manage food, waste and wastewater.<br>Off grid can also be applied to electrical and computer communications and networking.

 <br>Inspired by the article <a data-href="#How to Get Your Apartment Off the Grid" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/about:blank#How_to_Get_Your_Apartment_Off_the_Grid" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">How to Get Your Apartment Off the Grid</a><br>The idea is to build a personal grid within the larger grid: a grid for your household, which allows you to use the larger grid as backup until all the kinks have been worked out, and the personal grid is ready for full time energy production and usage.<br>A bank of batteries an associated circuitry is necessary as the heart of the system. There are commercially available options becoming available for this (the Zendure SuperBase is a good example in 2023). Power production can be handled by a mixture of solar panels, wind or water turbines, and even people-powered generators (the Green Microcycle is a good example of this option in 2023).<br>Of course the main point of the article below still stands: one cannot live on a personal grid with the same electricity usage habits one had on a public grid. Power saving strategies will have to be enacted to make long term success possible. The cost of initial purchase, maintaining, repairing, and replacing equipment is definitely something to be considered.<br>Making one of these grids is not easy, but it is worth the cost.<br><br>Solar panels on window sills and balconies can supply more power than you would think.<br>By Kris De Decker, May 17, 2016<br>The typical solar PV power installation requires access to a private roof and a big budget. However, wouldn’t it be possible to get around these obstacles by installing small solar panels on window sills and balconies, connected to a low-voltage direct current (DC) distribution network? To put this theory to the test, I decided to power Low-tech Magazine’s home office in Spain with solar energy, and write my articles off the grid.<br>Solar panels have become cheaper and more efficient in recent years, but they are far from a universal solution, even in sunny regions. One reason is that a typical solar photovoltaic (PV) installation is still beyond the budget of many people. The average pricing for a 5kW residential PV system completed in 2014 varied from $11,000 in Germany to $16,450 in the USA. Roughly half of that amount concerns the installation costs. <br>A second obstacle for solar power is that not everybody lives in a single-family dwelling with access to a private roof. Those who reside in apartment buildings have little chance of harvesting solar power with a conventional roof-mounted system. Furthermore, in apartment buildings, the roof would quickly become too crowded to cover the electricity use of all residents, a problem that grows larger the more floors there are in a building. Lastly, a typical solar installation is problematic when you’re renting a place, whether it’s a house or an apartment.<br>I’m one of those people who runs into every one of these obstacles: I live in a flat, I rent the place, and I don’t have the budget for a conventional solar system. However, I receive a lot of sunshine. My apartment is located near Barcelona in Spain, a city with an average solar insolation of almost 1,700 kWh/m2/year (which is also the average figure across the USA). Furthermore, the 60 m2 apartment has the balcony and all windows facing south-south-west, and there is no shading by trees or other buildings.<br>These conditions allow me to get through the winter without a heating system, relying only on solar heat and thermal underclothing. Hot water is supplied by a solar boiler, which was installed by the landlord. Clothes are dried on the balcony. While tinkering with solar panels for an art project, I got an idea: with the sun already powering so much of my living space, wouldn’t it also be possible to harvest solar power from the window sills and the balcony and take my apartment off the electricity grid? Such a PV installation would solve my problems:<br>
<br>I don’t need access to the roof.
<br>I can install the system myself, which makes it much cheaper.
<br>I can take the solar installation with me if I move to another place.
<br>Obviously, the big question is whether or not such an unconventional solar system could generate the necessary electricity. As a first experiment, I decided to power my 10 m2 home office with solar panels placed on the 2.8 m long window ledge that runs along the windows of the office and the adjacent bedroom.<br><br>The window in my office is quite small (at 1.5 m2, it takes up only half of one wall). However, there’s no need for power in the bedroom, which has been lighted by three IKEA SUNNAN lamps for years. Consequently, the full window ledge is available to power the home office. It offers enough space for five solar panels of 10W each, providing me with 50 watt-peak of solar power. The balcony will serve to power the rest of the apartment, and the plans for that second project are outlined at the end of this article.<br>With their placement on the window sill, the panels are shaded by the building itself in the morning. They receive direct sunlight from about 10 am to 5 pm in the pit of winter (a total of 7 hours), and from roughly 1 pm to 9 pm in the height of summer (a total of 8 hours). The maximum energy production is thus roughly 400 Wh per day.<br>The solar panels are connected in parallel and coupled to a solar charge controller and 550 Wh of lead-acid batteries. Assuming a 33% Depth-Of-Discharge (DoD) and a round-trip battery efficiency of 80%, this gives me a maximum energy storage of roughly 150 Wh.<br>
Can you power a home office with 50 watt-peak solar panels and 150 Wh of energy storage?
<br>Now let’s look at the energy use of my home office, before it was solar powered. I sit here working most of the days, either researching, writing, or building and repairing stuff. Devices that regularly use electricity are:<br>
<br>A laptop, which requires an average 20 watts of power.
<br>An external computer screen, which needs 16.5W of power.
<br>Two CFL lamps (20W and 12W) and one LED-lamp (3W).
<br><br>This adds up to 35W of power during the day (with only the laptop and the screen in use) and 70W after sunset (the laptop, the screen, and the lights). I usually work in the mornings and evenings, roughly from 10 am to 2 pm and from 8 pm to 1 am. During the afternoon, I do other stuff or I work in the library.<br>Total electricity use in my office is thus (on average) 500 Wh per day, with little variation between winter and summer. On cloudy days I also use lights in morning, which can raise energy use to 640 Wh per day. Then there are some devices that occasionaly need power:<br>
<br>A laser printer, which uses 4Wh of energy for warming up and printing eight text pages. This corresponds to operating my desk lamp (5W) for more than 45 minutes. A pair of PC loudspeakers (1.5W of power).
<br>Three USB bicycle lights (each use 1.4W of power while charging).
<br>A digital camera, which uses 3W while charging.
<br>A fan, which uses 30-40 watts of power.
<br>A mobile phone (a dumb one) that’s charged once every few weeks.
<br>Obviously, my solar PV system doesn’t produce enough energy to power my home office. While regular electricity use is at least 500 Wh on a 9-hour working day, the window sills give me a maximum of 400 Wh per day. On overcast days, energy production can be as low as 40 to 200 Wh per day, depending on the type of cloud cover. Furthermore, energy storage is only 150 Wh under ideal circumstances, while most energy use (350 Wh) is after sunset.<br>And yet, here I am, typing this article on a solar powered laptop in a room that’s lit by solar power. How is this possible? By following these strategies:<br>
<br>Maximize solar power production by tilting the panels according to the season.
<br>Minimize power use by installing a low-voltage DC grid and using DC appliances.
<br>Force yourself to lower energy demand on dark days by going off the grid.
<br>Below, we look at these points in more detail. My solar system has been in operation since November 2015, initially with only two 10W panels. Three more panels were added in early spring.<br><br>Roof-mounted solar panels usually have a fixed angle in relation to the sun. Because the elevation of the sun varies throughout the year, a fixed angle is always a compromise. Panels that lay horizontal on a flat roof are relatively well positioned for energy production in summer, but much less so for use in winter. On the other hand, tilted solar panels perform much better in winter but not as well as in summer. On sloped roofs, the angle of the panels is often determined by the angle of the roof, which isn’t necessarily the best angle for solar power production.<br>
A PV panel that’s optimally tilted towards the winter sun can triple electricity generation compared to a horizontally placed panel
<br>Adjusting the angle of a solar panel according to the season can increase electricity production significantly in winter. In December, a PV panel in Barcelona that’s optimally tilted towards the winter sun can triple electricity generation compared to a horizontally placed panel. Because the advantage is much smaller in other seasons, the average annual increase in power production is less than 10%. However, tilting the panels is the key to harvesting enough solar power during the winter months, when power shortages are most probable.<br>In the case of a balcony or window sill solar PV system, adjusting the angle of the solar panels is as simple as watering the plants. Although you could make small adjustments every hour, day or month, adapting the angle two or four times per year is as far as you should go.<br>There’s another advantage to having the solar panels so close at hand: they can be cleaned regularly. Roof-mounted solar panels rarely get cleaned because the roof usually isn’t very accessible. Losses due to dust and dirt are assumed to be 1% of generated energy, but in dry and dusty regions, as well as in traffic-heavy areas, they can be as high as 4-6% if washing is not undertaken on a regular basis. <br>
Adjusting the angle of a window sill solar panel is as simple as watering the plants
<br>Obviously, it’s crucial that the panels don’t fall off the window ledge, no matter what happens. Window sills differ in shapes and sizes, which calls for a custom-made supporting structure. I have a fixed metal bar at my window sill, aimed at protecting plant containers, which allows me to securely lock the solar panels in place. I guess I’m lucky to have this, but it also shows how small design changes can make a big difference. As an additional safety measure, I loaded the wooden base of each panel with some heavy rocks.<br>Adding a mechanism to vary the tilt of the panels complicates the design, because the moving part has to be just as sturdy as the base. Following some failed attempts, I found a mechanism that seems to work, using vintage Meccano rods (2-3 layers thick and with larger nuts and bolts). One rod is connected to the base of the structure, while another is connected to the wooden board that carries the panel. Both rods are connected to each other in the middle. Loosening this connection allows me to adjust the length of the supports and thus the angle of the solar panels.<br><br>Some readers might consider my approach soon-to-be-obsolete, because several companies are working on “solar PV windows”: glass that doubles as an electricity generator. However, this technology would not perform as well as adjustable solar panels on window sills, for several reasons.<br>First of all, solar PV windows are most often entirely vertical, which is never an efficient angle to generate solar power — their power generation is about 3 times lower than horizontal panels. Secondly, in summer it would be impossible to open the windows or lower the shutters, which would quickly overheat my office and introduce a need for air-conditioning.<br>My solar PV installation, on the other hand, can produce power when the shutters are closed and when the windows are open. Last but not least, a window-integrated solar panel can’t be taken with you when you move, while my system is entirely mobile.<br><br>Typical solar PV systems convert the direct current (DC) electricity produced by solar panels into alternating current (AC) in order to make it compatible with the AC distribution system in a building. Because many modern appliances operate internally on DC, the AC electricity is then converted back to DC. The DC/AC-conversion is done by an inverter, which sits between the solar charge controller and the load. The second conversion happens in the (external or internal) AC/DC adapter of the devices that are being used.<br>The trouble with this double energy conversion is that it generates substantial energy losses. This is especially true in the case of solid-state devices such as LEDs and computers, where the combined losses of the DC/AC/DC conversion amount to roughly 30%. Because these are also the devices that make up most of the load in my home office, it makes a lot of sense to avoid these losses by building a low-voltage DC system instead.<br>Like in a boat or a camper, the 12V DC electricity of my solar panels is used directly by 12V DC appliances, or stored in 12V DC batteries. If my solar panels generate their maximum output of 50W, my devices have 50W available. When battery power is involved, charging and discharging the battery adds 20% of energy loss, which leaves 40W available for the appliances.<br>
The choice for a low voltage DC system raises energy efficiency by 40%
<br>On the other hand, in a typical solar PV installation where a DC/AC/DC energy conversion takes place, the devices would only have 35W available, and the rest would be lost as heat during energy conversion. If lead-acid battery storage is used in such a system, only 28W of power remains. In short, in my specific case, choosing a DC system multiplies power production by 1.4 times.<br>The choice for a DC system saves not only energy but also space and costs. Less solar panels are needed and there’s no need to buy a DC/AC inverter, which is a costly device that needs to be replaced at least once during the life of a solar system. Most importantly, you can build a DC solar power system yourself, even if you’re as clumsy as I am. A low-voltage DC grid (up to 24V) is safe to handle because it carries no risk of electric shock.  Adding up all costs, I took my home office off the grid for less than 400 euro.<br><br>Mounting a DC system implies the use of DC-compatible devices. However, because so many modern appliances operate internally on DC, this doesn’t mean that you have to buy everything anew. To adapt the lighting in my office, I simply cut the mains plugs from the power cords, replaced them with DC-compatible plugs that fit straight into my solar charge controller, and substituted the light bulbs with 12V LED-bulbs. To run the laptop on DC, I replaced the power adapter by a DC-compatible power cord, which is available for use in cars. These power cords can be bought for every laptop model you can imagine.<br>Other devices are harder to adapt because the AC/DC adapter is located in the device itself. For example, I haven’t figured out yet how to convert my external computer screen to operate directly on DC power.<br>Appliances that cannot be converted are usually available in a 12V DC version. Examples are refrigerators, slow cookers, televisions, air compressors, or power tools. These can be more expensive than their AC counterparts, because they are produced in much smaller quantities. DC refrigerators are very expensive because they use vacuum insulation. While this makes sense in a camper or sailboat where space is restricted, it’s a needless cost in a common building.<br>The cigarette lighter receptacle in cars, initially designed to power an electrically heated cigarette lighter, has been the de facto standard DC connector for decades. More recently, it has been joined by another low voltage DC distribution system, the USB connector. USB cables operate on 5V DC and can transfer both data and energy. Many consumer electronics are now powered by them.<br>Currently, these devices are charged by the USB-port of a laptop or desktop computer, but they could be plugged straight into a solar PV system. While the standard USB-cable carries a maximum power of only 10 watts, the newer USB-PD standard accommodates devices with a power consumption of up to 100 watts.<br>
Overcast Days<br>The choice for a DC system has lowered power consumption in my home office considerably. My laptop’s energy use has decreased by about 20%. Switching to DC-direct LED-lamps has halved power use for lighting from 35 to 16W. Based on the 9-hour working day described earlier, daily energy use of regularly used devices in my home office has come down from 500 to 350 Wh/day. This brings average energy use below energy production on sunny days (400 Wh), which are plentiful where I live.<br>In reality, the external computer screen and the laser printer are still running on grid power. The 350 Wh of energy use mentioned above includes the hypothetical use of a DC external screen (saving 15% of power compared to the AC version), but not the energy use of the printer. However, on sunny days, I have a significant surplus of electricity, which suggests that I could also operate the external screen and the printer. Even on partly cloudy days energy is abundant.<br>However, energy use remains too high during overcast days, when power production is between 40 and 200 Wh per day. Obviously, adding more solar panels and batteries would solve the issue, but that’s not the way to go because the solar PV system would become more expensive, less practical, and less sustainable.<br>On sunny or partly cloudy days, I have more than enough electricity. On overcast days, I have to reduce energy demand.
Copy<br>To guarantee a daily 350 Wh of electricity during three consecutive heavy overcast days in December (a worst case scenario of only 40 Wh energy production per day), I would need to increase solar power capacity fourfold, from 50 to 200W peak capacity, and provide at least five times more batteries.<br>Although it would be possible to install 200W on the window sills, in that case the solar panels would stop solar light and heat from entering the rooms, which would be counterproductive. Furthermore, I would produce way too much electricity for most of the year.<br><br>There’s another option to make the numbers match if there’s not enough sun available, and that’s using less energy. Suggesting a reduction in energy use is rather controversial, but there are a surprisingly large number of ways to reduce energy use, without having to revert to a typewriter and candles. Here are some possibilities for my home office:<br>
<br>I could install a second working desk right next to the window. This eliminates the need for artificial lighting on dark winter days, which saves me at least another 40 Wh on days that electricity production is at its lowest.
<br>I could use less lights in evening during low solar power days. For most of the year, I have sufficient energy available to use all the lights in the room. However, most of the days I get by with only two lamps, and if necessary I could use a single 5W or even 3W lamp. When solar production is at its lowest, the latter still gives me more than 13 hours of light. I will never have to spend a night in the dark.
<br>I could shift loads towards sunny afternoons. Even in winter, the batteries can already be fully charged by around 2 or 3 pm on sunny days. Adding extra load to the system during these periods takes advantage of solar energy that would otherwise get wasted. This is when I can charge the bicycle lights, the digital camera or the phone, or when I can use the 12V soldering iron (my only power tool) or the printer. In summer I can use the surplus of energy to power two small USB-fans, and of course that’s the time when I need the fans the most.
<br>
There are a surprisingly large number of ways to reduce energy use, without having to revert to a typewriter and candles
<br>
<br>I could change my working schedule. If I could manage to work from 9 am to 6 pm instead of in morning and evening, I obtain a double energy savings. I would need no more lighting, except for one hour or so in winter (which saves 70 to 80 Wh/day). Secondly, I would use more electricity while it’s being generated, avoiding 20% battery charging and discharging losses while operating the laptop at night and in mornings (which saves another 30Wh). Changing my working schedule would lower daily electricity use to roughly 125Wh, less than half of maximum power production. Furthermore, all battery capacity would be available for overcast days, because there is no energy use at night.
<br>I could adapt computer work to solar conditions. There’s a remarkable difference in power use for the laptop between writing (roughly 15W) and surfing the web (roughly 25W). In other words, I can work almost twice as long when I’m writing, which I could do whenever available energy is low.
<br>I could ditch my external computer screen. It can be very handy for some work, giving both a screen to read and a screen to write, but most of the time it’s just wasting energy without being very useful. Ditching the external screen would save me another 150 Wh per day. However, it would probably increase the use of the printer, so it remains to be seen if this option really saves energy.
<br>During consecutive, heavy overcast days, I could revert to more drastic measures, like working in the library or not working at all. Or, I could do work that doesn’t involve any energy use during the day, such as reading books and taking notes by hand. This would bring extra advantages; it can be refreshing to disconnect and concentrate on something in the old-fashioned way. Going out one evening is a fun and easy way to keep the power level high enough during periods of bad weather.
<br>I could build a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/03/how-to-build-a-practical-household-bike-generator/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/03/how-to-build-a-practical-household-bike-generator/" target="_blank">pedal powered generator</a> for when I really need more electricity during overcast days. Strictly speaking, this is not a reduction of energy demand, but of course it implies an effort from my side. Pedalling for 1 to 1.5 hours would generate roughly 100 Wh of electricity, which would allow me to work on the computer for 3 to 5 hours, or to operate the 5W LED-light throughout the night.
<br>By keeping an eye on my barometer and being a bit flexible, it’s not that hard to plan work according to the weather. However, until now I managed to take advantage of these opportunities mostly when it comes to lighting, and less so when using the laptop. This has nothing to do with computer use being less flexible than lighting. Rather, it’s a consequence of how the system is built.<br>This became clear due to the rather clumsy way that I set up my experiment. Obviously, I wanted to test the installation in the depth of winter before writing about it. However, I only had two solar panels at the time. Therefore, I first tested my solar powered home office by running the laptop on solar energy for two weeks (while running the lights on grid power), followed by a two-week test of running the lights on solar energy (and the computer on grid power).<br>
For lighting, it’s impossible to fall back on grid power because I had to cut the power cords of all lamps to make them compatible with the 12V DC grid
<br>The results were remarkably different for both periods. With the laptop, I could always fall back on grid power by simply switching the power cord. Consequently, there were no external factors that forced me to change my way of working in order to remain within the limits of the energy budget on a dark day. For lighting, however, it was impossible to fall back on grid power. I had to cut the power cords of all lamps to make them compatible with the 12V DC grid, which meant that I could not run them on AC grid power anymore.<br>During low power periods, I had no other choice than to lower energy demand for lighting, and that’s exactly what I did, quite effortlessly I must say. I quickly made an extra desk at the window to avoid using artificial lights in morning, I switched the lights off whenever I left the room, and I worked with just a 5W or even a 3W light bulb if necessary.<br>Five months later, I have become totally accustomed to adjusting light levels to available solar power. On the other hand, I keep plugging my laptop into the grid if energy runs low. Why? Because I can. <br>Consequently, going off-grid seems to be the key to lowering energy demand considerably.  Having a limited energy supply also encourages the use of more energy efficient technology. For example, the energy savings I made by replacing the two remaining CFL lamps by LEDs could also have been achieved without building a solar PV system. However, the option only occurred to me after I took up the challenge of powering the office with solar energy.<br>
Progress in energy efficient technology will steadily increase the possibilities of my off-grid system, with no risks of rebound effects
<br>If I would not be able to fall back on grid power, I would probably also get a more energy efficient laptop. In the future, I could also switch to lithium-ion batteries, which have lower losses than lead-acid batteries. Investing in more energy efficient technology would allow me to run the computer and the lights longer with the same amount of solar panels. With a limited power supply, there’s no risk of rebound effects that negate these benefits.<br><br>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, the solar powered home office is only the first step towards converting the whole apartment to solar power and going totally off-grid. The second project will be the installation of a solar system on the 6-metre long balcony in front of the living room and the (open) kitchen. It will power the lights, the stereo-installation, the Wifi-router, all computer use outside the office, and all kitchen appliances.<br>This second experiment is much more challenging for two reasons. First, the living room and kitchen will also be used by the second person in this household, which will make it more complicated to manage energy use. Furthermore, although we don’t have a toaster, a coffeemaker, or a microwave, the kitchen houses a much used high power appliance: the electric cookstove.<br>Because it would take too many solar panels and batteries to power the electric cookstove by solar PV panels, the plan is to replace it by non-electric alternatives: one or two solar cookers, a fireless cooker, and a rocket stove for the morning coffee. By using direct solar heat, we can make much more efficient use of the space on the balcony. Another plan is to build a low-tech food storage system that can store most of the food outside the refrigerator, keeping this energy-intensive appliance as small as possible or eliminating it altogether.<br>
The balcony solar PV system will be totally independent of the window sill solar PV system
<br>The balcony solar PV system will be totally independent of the window sill solar PV system. There are several advantages to this approach. As we have seen in the previous article, cable losses are relatively high in a low-voltage DC system. Setting up several independent systems greatly limits cable length (and cable clutter).<br>Secondly, installing separate systems allows total power use to surpass 150 watts — which is the safety limit for a 12V DC system. Thirdly, multiple systems make it possible to start small and gradually expand the system. This avoids large upfront costs and allows you to learn from your mistakes.<br><br>In fact, it was one such mistake that made me decide to install two separate systems even in my relatively small 10 m2 home office. The two solar panels in front of the office are connected to half of the batteries (powering the lights), while the three solar panels in front of the bedroom are connected to the other half (powering the laptop).<br>This is because I short-circuited my first solar charge controller and had to buy a second one while the first one was being repaired. It was that or go without lights for three weeks. Thus, a final advantage of multiple systems is increased reliability: if one system fails, there is still electricity.<br>If the second experiment succeeds, and of course this remains to be seen, the plan is to stop the contract with our power provider, which is to be renewed in December. Obviously, it would be handy to keep a connection to the grid, but there are two important reasons not to do this. The first has been outlined above: going off-grid unleashes the creativity and willingness to lower energy demand.<br>Secondly, installing a solar system and holding on to a grid connection is financially disadvantageous. At least here in Spain, more than two-thirds of the electricity bill consists of fixed costs. Even if we would use much less grid electricity because of the solar system, our bill would remain more or less the same.<br>
If the second experiment succeeds, and of course this remains to be seen, the plan is to stop the contract with our power provider
<br>Some important challenges remain, most notably the washing machine, the bathroom and the laser printer. The problem with washing machine and bathroom is that they’re on the north side of the building, far from the solar panels. We could go to a laundromat but there are none in town. A pedal powered washing machine requires space that we don’t have.<br>The laser printer could be operated with an inverter, which can also be handy to power any other occasional device that doesn’t run on 12V DC power. However, a relatively large and expensive inverter would be needed, because the startup power of the machine is above 400 watts. Luckily, I found that out before I fried another costly device.<br><br>There are some things to keep in mind before you decide to install a low-tech solar PV system:<br>
<br>You need enough sun. Solar panels on balconies and window ledges won’t work everywhere. A similar system like mine, but 1,000 km further up north, would produce on average only half the electricity, with a much larger difference between winter and summer.
<br>You need the right exposure. Even if you’re in a sunny climate, don’t think of harvesting solar power if windows or balconies are oriented towards the north, the northwest, or the northeast. Shading by other buildings or trees can also smother your ambitions. You need at least 4 hours of direct sunshine on the panels each day.
<br>You need to be prepared to lower your energy use. Few apartment dwellers will have enough space available to generate sufficient solar power for an energy-intensive lifestyle.
<br>It may be impossible to close some windows completely. The cables from the panels enter my apartment by slightly opening the sliding window of the office. In winter, I cover this gap with cork. I don’t use heating so no energy gets lost, but this might be problematic in other circumstances. You probably shouldn’t drill a hole through the window or the wall if you are renting the place.
<br>Converting your apartment to solar power doesn’t make you “100% sustainable”. Fossil fuels are used to produce solar panels and batteries. The electricity I generate is likely more CO2-intensive per kWh than Spanish grid electricity, especially since my panels and batteries are manufactered in China. The only reason why my system is more sustainable than using grid electricity is because it forces me to lower electricity use considerably.

 <br>Lightning (pictured) and urban lighting are some of the most dramatic effects of electricity<br>Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.<br>The presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, a force acts on a charge with a magnitude given by Coulomb's law. Electric potential is typically measured in volts.<br>Electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:<br>
<br>Electric power where electric current is used to energise equipment;
<br>Electronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.
<br>Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the 17th and 18th centuries. The theory of electromagnetism was developed in the 19th century, and by the end of that century electricity was being put to industrial and residential use by electrical engineers. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and <a data-href="computation" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/computation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">computation</a>. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.<br><br>Thales, the earliest known researcher into electricity<br>Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the "Thunderer of the Nile", and described them as the "protectors" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.<br>Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.<br>Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.<br>Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De&nbsp;Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber.He coined the Neo-Latin word electricus ("of amber" or "like amber", from ἤλεκτρον, elektron, the Greek word for "amber") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words "electric" and "electricity", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.<br>Further work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behaviorof the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.<br>“Electricity - Wikipedia/170px-M_Faraday_Th_Phillips_oil_1842.jpg” could not be found.<br>Michael Faraday's discoveries formed the foundation of electric motor technology.<br>In 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his "On Physical Lines of Force" in 1861 and 1862.<br>While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.<br>In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for "his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.<br>The first solid-state device was the "cat's-whisker detector" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.<br>Solid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.<br><br><br>The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity.  A lightweight ball suspended by a fine thread can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.<br>The force acts on the charged particles themselves, hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them. The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances. In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 10&gt;42&gt; times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together.<br>Charge originates from certain types of subatomic particles, the most familiar carriers of which are the electron and proton. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.<br>The charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign, hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated with the work of Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10&gt;−19&gt;&nbsp;coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10&gt;−19&gt;&nbsp; coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.<br>Charge can be measured by a number of means, an early instrument being the gold-leaf electroscope, which although still in use for classroom demonstrations, has been superseded by the electronic electrometer.<br><br>The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.<br>By historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.<br>The process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second,  the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.<br>Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840.  One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass. He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.<br>In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave.  Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance.  These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.<br><br>The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.<br>An electric field generally varies in space, and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, having both magnitude and direction, so it follows that an electric field is a vector field.<br>The study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday,  whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines.  Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.  <br>A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore 0 at all places inside the body.   This is the operating principal of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects.<br>The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30&nbsp;kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1&nbsp;kV per centimetre.   The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100&nbsp;MV and have discharge energies as great as 250&nbsp;kWh.<br>The field strength is greatly affected by nearby conducting objects, and it is particularly intense when it is forced to curve around sharply pointed objects. This principle is exploited in the lightning conductor, the sharp spike of which acts to encourage the lightning strike to develop there, rather than to the building it serves to protect. <br><br>A pair of AA cells. The +&nbsp;sign indicates the polarity of the potential difference between the battery terminals.<br>The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity.  This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated.   The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.<br>For practical purposes, it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable. <br>Electric potential is a scalar quantity, that is, it has only magnitude and not direction. It may be viewed as analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field.  As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, since otherwise there would be a force along the surface of the conductor that would move the charge carriers to even the potential across the surface.<br>The electric field was formally defined as the force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the electric field is the local gradient of the electric potential. Usually expressed in volts&nbsp;per&nbsp;metre, the vector direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together. <br><br>Ørsted's discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it.   Ørsted's words were that "the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner." The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too. <br>Ørsted did not fully understand his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. he interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere. <br>This relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained. <br>Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.<br><br>An electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path (a circuit), usually to perform some useful task.<br>The components in an electric circuit can take many forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components are those that are termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.<br>The resistor is perhaps the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance is a consequence of the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1&nbsp;Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.<br>The capacitor is a development of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.<br>The inductor is a conductor, usually a coil of wire, that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.<br><br>Electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.<br>Electric power, like mechanical power, is the rate of doing work, measured in watts, and represented by the letter P. The term wattage is used colloquially to mean "electric power in watts." The electric power in watts produced by an electric current I consisting of a charge of Q coulombs every t seconds passing through an electric potential (voltage) difference of V is<br>where<br>Q is electric charge in coulombs<br>t is time in seconds<br>I is electric current in amperes<br>V is electric potential or voltage in volts<br>Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using electricity meters, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency. <br><br>Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.  The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes digital switching possible,  and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.<br>Today, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The underlying principles that explain how semiconductors work are studied in solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems are part of electronics engineering. <br><br>Faraday's and Ampère's work showed that a time-varying magnetic field created an electric field, and a time-varying electric field created a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, a field of the other is always induced. These variations are an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that in a vacuum such a wave would travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's equations, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.<br>The work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents and, via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances. <br><br><br>In the 6th century BC the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods: these were the first studies into the production of electricity. While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electricity. <br>Electrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators. These can be driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion or the heat released from nuclear reactions, but also more directly from the kinetic energy of wind or flowing water. The steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 is still used to convert the thermal energy of steam into a rotary motion that can be used by electro-mechanical generators. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. Electricity generated by solar panels rely on a different mechanism: solar radiation is converted directly into electricity using the photovoltaic effect. <br>Demand for electricity grows with great rapidity as a nation modernises and its economy develops. The United States showed a 12% increase in demand during each year of the first three decades of the twentieth century,  a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of India or China. <br>Environmental concerns with electricity generation, in specific the contribution of fossil fuel burning to climate change, have led to an increased focus on generation from renewable sources. In the power sector, wind and solar have become cost effective, speeding up an energy transition away from fossil fuels.<br><br>The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed. <br>Normally, demand of electricity must match the supply, as storage of electricity is difficult. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses. With increasing levels of variable renewable energy (wind and solar energy) in the grid, it has become more challenging to match supply and demand. Storage plays an increasing role in bridging that gap. There are four types of energy storage technologies, each in varying states of technology readiness: batteries (electrochemical storage), chemical storage such as hydrogen, thermal or mechanical (such as pumped hydropower).<br>Those who wish to go truly "<a data-href="off grid" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Off Grid/off grid.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">off grid</a>" end up creating <a data-href="tiny personal grid" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Off Grid/tiny personal grid.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">tiny personal grid</a>s, which have the same challenges outlined above.<br><br>Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.<br>The resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, it can be seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station.  A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.Electrification is expected to play a major role in the decarbonisation of sectors that rely on direct fossil fuel burning, such as transport (using electric vehicles) and heating (using heat pumps). <br>The effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and an increasing number of battery-powered electric cars in private ownership.<br>Electricity is used within telecommunications, and indeed the electrical telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first transcontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process.<br>Electronic devices make use of the transistor, perhaps one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain many billions of miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.<br><br><br>A voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current.  The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with the path of the current, but is about 0.1&nbsp;mA to 1&nbsp;mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions.  If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock—electrocution—is still used for judicial execution in some US states, though its use had become very rare by the end of the 20th century.<br><br>Electricity is not a human invention, and may be observed in several forms in nature, notably lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is due to the natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when pressed. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal: when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field it changes size slightly.<br>Some organisms, such as sharks, are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon; these are electric fish in different orders. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants. <br><br>It is said that in the 1850s, British politician William Gladstone asked the scientist Michael Faraday why electricity was valuable. Faraday answered, "One day sir, you may tax it."  However, according to Snopes.com, "the anecdote should be considered apocryphal, however, because it isn't mentioned in any accounts by Faraday or his contemporaries (letters, newspapers, or biographies) and only popped up well after Faraday's death." <br>In the 19th and early 20th century, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicted it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature. This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. "Revitalization" or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after Galvani's work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored Frankenstein (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.<br>As the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light,  such as the workers who "finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires" in Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem Sons of Martha.  Electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of Jules Verne and the Tom Swift books. The masters of electricity, whether fictional or real—including scientists such as Thomas Edison, Charles Steinmetz or Nikola Tesla—were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers. <br>With electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century, it required particular attention by popular culture only when it stops flowing, an event that usually signals disaster.  The people who keep it flowing, such as the nameless hero of Jimmy Webb's song "Wichita Lineman" (1968), are still often cast as heroic, wizard-like figures.<br><br>

 <br>Aquaponics is a food production system that couples aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as fish, crayfish, snails or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) whereby the nutrient-rich aquaculture water is fed to hydroponically grown plants.<br>As existing hydroponic and aquaculture farming techniques form the basis of all aquaponic systems, the size, complexity, and types of foods grown in an aquaponic system can vary as much as any system found in either distinct farming discipline.]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Permaculture/Aquaponics/Aquaponics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Natural/Permaculture/Aquaponics/Aquaponics.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 02:15:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hydroponics]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Hydroponics is a type of horticulture and a subset of hydroculture which involves growing plants, usually crops or medicinal plants, without soil, by using water-based mineral nutrient solutions. Terrestrial or aquatic plants may grow with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid or the roots may be mechanically supported by an inert medium such as perlite, gravel, or other substrates.<br>Despite inert media, roots can cause changes of the rhizosphere pH and root exudates can affect rhizosphere biology and physiological balance of the nutrient solution when secondary metabolites are produced in plants. Transgenic plants grown hydroponically allow the release of pharmaceutical proteins as part of the root exudate into the hydroponic medium.<br>The nutrients used in hydroponic systems can come from many different organic or inorganic sources, including fish excrement, duck manure, purchased chemical fertilizers, or artificial standard or hybrid nutrient solutions.<br>In contrast to field cultivation, plants are commonly grown hydroponically in a greenhouse or contained environment on inert media, adapted to the controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) process. Plants commonly grown hydroponically include tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, strawberries, lettuces, and cannabis, usually for commercial use, as well as Arabidopsis thaliana, which serves as a model organism in plant science and genetics.<br>Hydroponics offers many advantages, notably a decrease in water usage in agriculture. To grow 1 kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb) of tomatoes using intensive farming methods requires 214 liters (47&nbsp;imp&nbsp;gal; 57&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gal) of water; using hydroponics, 70 liters (15&nbsp;imp&nbsp;gal; 18&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gal); and only 20 liters (4.4&nbsp;imp&nbsp;gal; 5.3&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gal) using aeroponics.<br>Hydroponic cultures lead to highest biomass and protein production compared to other growth substrates, of plants cultivated in the same environmental conditions and supplied with equal amounts of nutrients.<br>Since hydroponic growing takes much less water and nutrients to grow produce, and climate change threatens agricultural yields, it could be possible in the future for people in harsh environments with little accessible water to hydroponically grow their own plant-based food.<br>Hydroponics is not only used on earth, but has also proven itself in plant production experiments in space.<br>Hydropoic Methods:<br>

 <br><br>Hydroponics may provide the answer, and Kratky Method Hydroponics is the simplest way to start.&nbsp;<br><br>Hydroponics have been around since the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which was built around 600 B.C. &nbsp;Modern hydroponics made significant advancements about 100 years ago at UC Berkeley when Dr. William Gericke grew 25 ft tall tomato plants without soil. &nbsp;One of the people who studied Dr. Gericke's work was Bernard Kratky who went on to receive his Masters and Ph. D. in Horticulture from Purdue University.  <br>The key concept about the Kratky Method is it is one of the few&nbsp;passive&nbsp;hydroponic methods. &nbsp;This means no electricity is used to pump air or water. &nbsp;This graphic shows the separation between passive and active hydroponics. &nbsp;<br><br>
![[Media/Images/kratky-images-6_orig.jpg]]
## Air roots<br><br>Notice the fine, white roots just below the cup. &nbsp;These are "air roots" and they develop in the moist air space above the nutrient water. &nbsp;This is a special adaptation that plants make to absorb oxygen from the air while the water roots below the air roots absorb the nutrient water. &nbsp; You may know that plants absorb carbon dioxide? &nbsp;They do that through the leaves while oxygen is absorbed through the roots. &nbsp;The discovery of this adaptability of plants was revolutionary and critical for the success of this method since air pumps are not used. &nbsp; These air roots are fragile and should never be submersed. Even splashing them with water can stress the plant. &nbsp;They can also be damaged if not kept in a moist environment.<br><br><br><br>
<br>People have been growing without soil in nutrient rich water for thousands of years
<br>Hydroponic growing methods are&nbsp;&nbsp;separated into passive (without&nbsp;pumps) and active (with&nbsp;pumps) &nbsp;methods.
<br>Dr. Bernard Kratky is one of the scientists who helped develop the most popular method&nbsp;of passive hydroponics which now bears his name.
<br>Success with the Kratky Method depends on understanding the concept of air roots which develop in the moist air space above the nutrient water.
<br>Air roots must not be submerged or splashed with water.

 <br>Permaculture is an approach to land management and settlement design that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems. It includes a set of design principles derived using whole-systems thinking. It applies these principles in fields such as regenerative agriculture, town planning, rewilding, and community resilience. The term was coined in 1978 by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren, who formulated the concept in opposition to modern industrialized methods, instead adopting a more traditional or "natural" approach to agriculture.<br>Related Topics:<br>

 <br>Anarchy: The Only Thing That Exists<br>Because Christ is King, any other is false.<br>Notice the necessity of coercion in worldly governance, it is a mark of illegitimacy.<br>Without actual authority, coercion is necessary to force compliance, there is no other option.<br>Mutual, voluntary, cooperation is the mark of those who comprehend the authority of Christ.<br>Those who either do not comprehend, or actively rebel against Christ, like Lucifer, attempt to make their own twisted and depraved version of the Only Kingdom.<br>-This is of course a great honor given to God, that His creation desires to be more fully like their Creator.<br>-However, there are times when we should be like ourselves.<br>Anarchy is the only thing that remains. No gods-but Yahweh, no kings-but Christ, no masters-but the Lord.<br>It is justice, that no human being stands over another human being in judgement.<br>Injustice, as a negation, is inherently unstable, and thus human and demonically prompted attempts at usurpation, will never stand for any great length of time.<br>The only response to these injustices, is that given by Christ: render to Caesar, what is Caesar's.<br>-Nonviolent, subversive, resistance is the limit. Descending into unjust violence, is the first step towards unjust usurpation, and thus, the first step towards evil.<br>-Taking Christ as exemplar: arrest and death is a real possibility, but that is no reason to shrink back from resistance to evil.<br>A major barrier to just resistance, is clinging to the perceived benefits of the usurpers via greed.<br>Unchecked consumerism, fear of being thrust into a position of being branded a troublemaker, sedate many into not engaging in the work of mercy and justice to resist usurpers.<br>The work is difficult, it requires working and living outside the sphere of influence of usurpers:<br>-Making raw materials.<br>-Crafting things from those raw materials.<br>-Making monetary systems.<br>-Aiding others in escaping the sedated masses.<br>A useful methodology to implement this work of resistance, is nomadism:<br>-Unbridled consumerism is difficult when you have to carry everything you own with you from place to place.<br>-In all things the nomad must rely on God completely.<br>-Many will hate nomads for various reasons, so a good reputation will be difficult to obtain in the first place.<br>However, many other attempts are useful and necessary: ascetic lives, hermetic lives, communal lives.<br>As we have done throughout the ages, guided by the Spirit, we must continue, as we follow the direction-and act in the strength-given by Christ, our true and only King.<br><br>Of course, anarchy as a concept has a long and venerable history, it is not necessarily sensible to force it to fit the reality I am attempting to express.<br>Conviviality, as extrapolated by <a class="internal-link" data-href="Ivan Illich.md" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/Ivan Illich.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ivan Illich</a>, might fit better. To be convivial, is to have autonomous, creative intercourse among persons and between individuals and their environment.<br>Like anarchy, the emphasis is on mutual, voluntary, cooperation. Without room for coercion, violence, or intimidation.<br>However, conviviality does not encompass the discussion of if there exists natural hierarchies present within (or outside of) the cosmos.<br>Obviously, for one who follows Jesus, there is at least a hierarchy between <a class="internal-link" data-href="God.md" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and Humanity. <br>However, this single hierarchical structure does not imply the existence of further structures. Also, due to what we know of the relationship between God and Humanity, there does not exist within it any coercion or violence. Which in and of itself lends credence to the inevitability of at least conviviality, if not anarchy.<br>Due to God not pressing His existence upon us by force, traditional anarchy, with it's "no gods, no kings, no masters" is also a credible comprehension of reality.<br>But for us who follow Christ, it is better to take up the title of convivial, and leave the title of anarchy to those who do not wish to consider the existence of a creator.<br>Convivial, with it's roots in the Latin convivium, is also a apropos for us Christians, due to it's inherent festal connotations. <br>The Eucharist, holding the pride of place in the Christian life, is the highest expression of conviviality: a feast and sacrifice, where both God and Humanity brings what it has to offer, and rejoices in communion. <br>We see this mutual cooperation, which brings great joy, and makes difficulties bearable with the action of a voluntary community, breaking through in human history again and again.<br><a class="internal-link" data-href="Dorothy Day.md" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/Dorothy Day.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dorothy Day</a>, co-founder of the Catholic Worker, recounts in her autobiography The Long Lonliness, how people came together to help each other after the San Francisco earthquake. She chased that reality of conviviality for the rest of her life. It's near in glory to the Eucharist, which is near in glory to Heaven.<br>Conviviality, when it happens, is the breaking-in of the Kingdom of God into this brutal and fallen world. Convivial action brings light and peace, in a cancerous way destroying the darkness and distress that haunts our daily life.<br>Where charity and love prevail, there God is ever found.]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Anarchy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Natural/Anarchy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2024 15:44:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[earth]]></title><description><![CDATA[

This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by <a data-href="vegetable" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/vegetable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">vegetable</a>, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.<br>Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76&nbsp;°C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.<br>Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000&nbsp;km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400&nbsp;km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces Earth with the same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.<br>Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth with the exception of Antarctica.<br><br>The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical (see <a data-href="electricity" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/electricity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">electricity</a>) and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05×10−5 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79×1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average). The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.<br>The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates. The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.<br>During magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/earth.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Natural/earth.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 02:15:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/app://7444c5a74fd1a40d72cea94d6afe5a6b110b/media/techpriest/Backup/Syncthing/Wikis/techpriest_wiki/Techpriest_Wiki/Media/Images/220px-The_Blue_Marble_(remastered).jpg?1706321716380" length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/app://7444c5a74fd1a40d72cea94d6afe5a6b110b/media/techpriest/Backup/Syncthing/Wikis/techpriest_wiki/Techpriest_Wiki/Media/Images/220px-The_Blue_Marble_(remastered).jpg?1706321716380"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[nature]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Etymologically (Latin natura from nasci, to be born, like the corresponding Greek physis from phyein, to bring forth) has reference to the production of things, and hence generally includes in its connotation the ideas of energy and activity. It will be convenient to reduce to two classes the various meanings of the term nature according as it applies to the natures of individual beings or to nature in general. <br>I. In an individual being, especially if its constitutive elements and its activities are manifold and complex, the term nature is sometimes applied to the collection of distinctive features, original or acquired, by which such an individual is characterized and distinguished from others. Thus it may be said it is the nature of one man to be taller, stronger, more intelligent, or more sociable than another. This meaning, however, is superficial; in philosophical terminology and even in ordinary language, nature refers to something deeper and more fundamental. These features are manifestations of a man's nature; they are not his nature. Nature properly signifies that which is primitive and original, or, according to etymology, that which a thing is at birth, as opposed to that which is acquired or added from external sources. But the line that divides the natural from the artificial cannot be drawn with precision. Inorganic beings never change except under the influence of external agencies, and in the same circumstances, their mode of activity is uniform and constant. Organisms present a greater complexity of structure, power of adaptation, and variety of function. For their development out of a primitive germ they require the co-operation of many external factors, yet they have within themselves the principle of activity by which external substances are elaborated and assimilated. In any being the changes due to necessary causes are called natural, whereas those produced by intentional human activity are called artificial. But it is clear that art supposes nature and is but a special adaptation of natural aptitudes, capacities, or activities for certain esthetic or useful purposes. Stars, rivers, forests, are works of nature; parks, canals, gardens, and machines are works of art. If necessary conditions are realized, where the seed falls a plant will grow naturally. But the seed may be placed purposely amid certain surroundings, the growth of the plant may be hastened, its shape altered, and, in general, the result to be expected from natural activities may be modified. By training the aptitudes of an animal are utilized and its instincts adapted for specific ends. In such cases the final result is more or less natural or artificial according to the mode and amount of human intervention.<br>In scholastic philosophy, nature, essence, and substance are closely related terms. Both essence and substance imply a static point of view and refer to constituents or mode of existence, while nature implies a dynamic point of view and refers to innate tendencies. Moreover, substance is opposed to accidents, whereas we may speak of the nature and essence not only of substances but also of accidents like colour, sound, intelligence, and of abstract ideals like virtue or duty. But when applied to the same substantial being, the terms substance, essence, and nature in reality stand only for different aspects of the same thing, and the distinction between them is a mental one. Substance connotes the thing as requiring no support, but as being itself the necessary support of accidents; essence properly denotes the intrinsic constitutive elements by which a thing is what it is and is distinguished from every other; nature denotes the substance or essence considered as the source of activities. "Nature properly speaking is the essence (or substance) of things which have in themselves as such a principle of activity (Aristotle, "Metaphysics", 1015a, 13). By a process of abstraction the mind arises from individual and concrete natures to those of species and genera.<br>A few special remarks must be added concerning human nature. This expression may mean something concrete, more or less different in various individuals, or more generally something common to all men, i.e., the abstract human nature by which mankind as a whole is distinguished from other classes of living beings. In both cases it is conceived as including primitive and fundamental characteristics, and as referring to the source of all activities. Hence nature, as the internal principle of action, is opposed in the first place to violence and coercion which are external principles of action and prevent the normal play of human faculties. It is opposed also, but less strictly, to education and culture which at times may be the checking of natural tendencies, at times also their development and perfection. Education, physical and mental, is not a primitive endowment; it must be acquired and is built upon nature as on its foundation. In this sense habit has been termed a second nature. But although education is due largely to external causes and influences acting on the mind and the organism, from another point of view it is also the unfolding of innate aptitudes, and hence partly natural.<br>As between nature in general and art, so between human nature and education there is no clear dividing line. Natural is also frequently contrasted with conventional; language, style, gestures, expressions of feelings, etc., are called more or less natural. This opposition becomes more acute in the theories of Hobbes and Rousseau who lay stress on the antithesis between the primitive or natural state of man and the present social condition due to the contract by which men agreed to surrender their rights into the hands of the common authority.<br>From the theological point of view the distinctions between nature and person and between the natural and the supernatural orders are of primary importance. The former arose from the dogma of the Trinity, i.e., of one Divine Nature in three persons, and chiefly from that of the Incarnation, i.e., of the two Natures, Divine and human, in the one Divine Person in Christ. The Human Nature in Christ is complete and perfect as nature, yet it lacks that which would make it a person, whether this be something negative, as Scotists hold, namely the mere fact that a nature is not assumed by a higher person, or, as Thomists assert, some positive reality distinct from nature and making it incommunicable.<br>The faculties of man are capable of development and perfection, and, no matter what external influences may be at work, this is but the unfolding of natural capacities. Even artificial productions are governed by the laws of nature, and, in man, natural activities, after they are perfected differ not in kind but only in degree, from those that are less developed. The supernatural order is above the exigencies and capacities of all human nature. It consists of an end to be reached, namely, the intuitive vision of God in heaven — not the mere discursive and imperfect knowledge which is acquired by the light of reason — and of the means to attain such an end, namely, a principle which must be added to natural faculties so as to uplift them and make them capable of knowing and reaching this higher destiny. More specifically it includes an enlightenment of the intellect by a positive revelation of God manifesting man's supernatural end and the conditions for obtaining it; it also implies for every individual the indispensable help of Divine grace both actual, by which God illumines and strengthens human faculties, and sanctifying, by which human nature is elevated to a higher mode of activity. Hence theologians oppose the state of pure nature in which God could have placed man, to the supernatural state to which in fact man was raised.<br>II. Nature is frequently taken for the totality of concrete natures and their laws. But here again a narrower and a broader meaning must be distinguished. Nature refers especially to the world of matter, in time and space, governed by blind and necessary laws and thus excludes the mental world. Works of nature, opposed to works of art, result from physical causes, not from the actual adaptation by human intelligence. This signification is found in such expressions as natural history, natural philosophy, and in general, natural science, which deal only with the constitution, production, properties, and laws of material substances. Sometimes also nature is all-inclusive, embracing mind as well as matter; it is our whole world of experience, internal as well as external. And frequently nature is looked upon as a personified abstraction, as the one cause of whatever takes place in the universe, endowed with qualities, tendencies, efforts, and will, and with aims and purposes which it strives to realize.<br>The problems to which the philosophical study of nature has given rise are numerous. All however centre around the question of the unity of nature: Can all the beings of the world be reduced to one common principle, and if so what is this principle? The first Greek philosophers, who were almost exclusively philosophers of nature, endeavoured to find some primitive element out of which all things were made; air, water, fire, and <a data-href="earth" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/earth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">earth</a> were in turn or all together supposed to be this common principle. The problem has persisted through all ages and received many answers. Aristotle's primary matter, for instance, is of the same nature in all things, and today ether, or some other substance or energy is advocated by many as the common substratum of all material substances. After static unity, dynamic unity is looked for, that is, all the changes that take place in the universe are referred to the same principle. Dynamism admits forces of various kinds which, however, it tries to reduce to as small a number as possible, if not to only one form of energy manifesting itself in different ways. Mechanism holds that everything is explainable by the sole assumption of movement communicated from one substance to another. Teleological views give to final causes a greater importance, and look upon the ends of various beings as subordinated to the one end which the universe tends to realize.<br>If nature includes both mental and physical phenomena, what are the relations between these two classes? On this point also the history of philosophy offers many attempts to substitute some form of Monism for the Dualism of mind and matter, by reducing mind to a special function of matter, or matter to a special appearance of mind, or both to a common substratum.<br>Finally, is nature as a whole self-sufficient, or does it require a transcendent ground as its cause and principle? Is the natura naturans one and the same with the natura naturata? By some these expressions are used in a pantheistic sense, the same substance underlies all phenomena; by others the natura naturans, as first cause, is held to be really distinct from the natura naturata, as effect. This is the question of the existence and nature of God and of his distinction from the world. Here the question of the possibility of miracles is suggested. If nature alone exists, and if all its changes are absolutely necessary, everything takes place according to a strict determinism. If, on the contrary, God exists as a transcendent, intelligent, and free cause of nature and its laws not only nature in all its details depends ultimately on God's will, but its ordinary course may be suspended by a miraculous intervention of the First Cause.

<br>In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.
<br>And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.
<br>And God said: Be light made. And light was made.
<br>And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.
<br>And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.
<br>And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.
<br>And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.
<br>And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.
<br>God also said; Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.
<br>And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
<br>And he said: let the earth bring forth green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.
<br>And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
<br>And the evening and the morning were the third day.
<br>And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:
<br>To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth, and it was so done.
<br>And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.
<br>And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth.
<br>And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
<br>And the evening and morning were the fourth day.
<br>God also said: let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.
<br>And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
<br>And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.
<br>And the evening and morning were the fifth day.
<br>And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done.
<br>And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
<br>And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.
<br>And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.
<br>And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.
<br>And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat:
<br>And to all beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done.
<br>And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.<br>

<br>So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.
<br>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
<br>And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
<br>These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth:
<br>And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.
<br>But a spring rose out of the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.
<br>And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.
<br>And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.
<br>And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
<br>And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.
<br>The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.
<br>And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.
<br>And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia.
<br>And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
<br>And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to keep it.
<br>And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:
<br>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.
<br>And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.
<br>And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature, the same is its name.
<br>And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.
<br>Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.
<br>And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.
<br>And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man.
<br>Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.
<br>And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.<br>

<br>Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?
<br>And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:
<br>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.
<br>And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.
<br>For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.
<br>And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.
<br>And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.
<br>And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.
<br>And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?
<br>And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.
<br>And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?
<br>And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
<br>And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.
<br>And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.
<br>I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.
<br>To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee.
<br>And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.
<br>Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.
<br>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.
<br>And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.
<br>And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife, garments of skins, and clothed them.
<br>And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.
<br>And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken.
<br>And he cast out Adam; and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<br>

<br>And Adam knew Eve his wife: who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through God.
<br>And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.
<br>And it came to pass after many days that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.
<br>Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.
<br>But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance fell.
<br>And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?
<br>If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.
<br>And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.
<br>And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?
<br>And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth.
<br>Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand.
<br>When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.
<br>And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.
<br>Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be hid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: everyone, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill me.
<br>And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but whosoever shall kill Cain shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.
<br>And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth, at the east side of Eden.
<br>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.
<br>And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech.
<br>And Lamech took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other Sella.
<br>And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.
<br>And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.
<br>Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.
<br>And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.
<br>Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.
<br>Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed for Abel, whom Cain slew.
<br>But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos: this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.<br>

<br>This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of God.
<br>He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
<br>And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth.
<br>And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters.
<br>And all the time that Adam lived came to nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
<br>Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enos.
<br>And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
<br>And Enos lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.
<br>After whose birth, he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.
<br>And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Malaleel.
<br>And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel, eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.
<br>And Malaleel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared.
<br>And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared, eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.
<br>And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Henoch.
<br>And Jared lived after he begot Henoch, eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.
<br>And Henoch lived sixty-five years and begot Mathusala.
<br>And Henoch walked with God: and lived after he begot Mathusala, three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
<br>And he walked with God, and was seen no more: because God took him.
<br>And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.
<br>And Mathusala lived after he begot Lamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.
<br>And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.
<br>And he called his name Noe, saying: This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth which the Lord hath cursed.
<br>And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five hundred and ninety-five years, and begot sons and daughters.
<br>And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.
<br>And Noe, when he was five hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.<br>

<br>And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and daughters were born to them,
<br>The sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took to themselves wives of all which they chose.
<br>And God said: My spirit shall not remain in man forever, because he is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
<br>Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men, and they brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown.
<br>And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,
<br>It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart,
<br>He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.
<br>But Noe found grace before the Lord.
<br>These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations, he walked with God.
<br>And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.
<br>And the earth was corrupted before God, and was filled with iniquity.
<br>And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth),
<br>He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.
<br>Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.
<br>And thus shalt thou make it. The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
<br>Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the side: with lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt thou make it.
<br>Behold, I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed.
<br>And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee.
<br>And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and the female.
<br>Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in their kind, and of everything that creepeth on the earth according to its kind; two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.
<br>Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.
<br>And Noe did all things which God commanded him.<br>

<br>And the Lord said to him: Go in, thou and all thy house, into the ark: for thee I have seen just before me in this generation.
<br>Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, the male and the female.
<br>But of the beasts that are unclean two and two, the male and the female. Of the fowls also of the air seven and seven, the male and the female: that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth.
<br>For yet a while, and after seven days, I will rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and I will destroy every substance that I have made, from the face of the earth.
<br>And Noe did all things which the Lord had commanded him.
<br>And he was six hundred years old, when the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.
<br>And Noe went in and his sons, his wife and the wives of his sons with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
<br>And of beasts clean and unclean, and of fowls, and of everything that moveth upon the earth,
<br>Two and two went in to Noe into the ark, male and female, as the Lord had commanded Noe.
<br>And after the seven days were passed, the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.
<br>In the six hundredth year of the life of Noe, in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the flood gates of heaven were opened:
<br>And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
<br>In the selfsame day Noe, and Sem, and Cham, and Japheth his sons: his wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark:
<br>They and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle in their kind, and everything that moveth upon the earth according to its kind, and every fowl according to its kind, all birds, and all that fly,
<br>Went in to Noe into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein was the breath of life.
<br>And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in on the outside.
<br>And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and the waters increased, and lifted up the ark on high from the earth.
<br>For they overflowed exceedingly: and filled all on the face of the earth: and the ark was carried upon the waters.
<br>And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the earth: and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
<br>The water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it covered.
<br>And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle, and of beasts, and of all creeping things that creep upon the earth: and all men.
<br>And all things wherein there is the breath of life on the earth, died.
<br>And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the earth, from man even to beast, and the creeping things and fowls of the air: and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noe only remained, and they that were with him in the ark.
<br>And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.<br>

<br>And God remembered Noe, and all the living creatures, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated.
<br>The fountains also of the deep, and the flood gates of heaven were shut up, and the rain from heaven was restrained.
<br>And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.
<br>And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.
<br>And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.
<br>And after that forty days were passed, Noe, opening the window of the ark which he had made, sent forth a raven:
<br>Which went forth and did not return till the waters were dried up upon the earth.
<br>He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.
<br>But she not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.
<br>And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.
<br>And she came to him in the evening, carrying a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth. Noe, therefore, understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.
<br>And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove, which returned not any more unto him.
<br>Therefore, in the six hundredth and first year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and Noe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.
<br>In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth was dried.
<br>And God spoke to Noe, saying:
<br>Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons and the wives of thy sons with thee.
<br>All living things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase and multiply upon it.
<br>So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.
<br>And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds, went out of the ark.
<br>And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.
<br>And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every living soul as I have done.
<br>All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not cease.<br>

<br>And God blessed Noe and his sons. And he said to them: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.
<br>And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all that move upon the earth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.
<br>And every thing that moveth, and liveth shall be meat for you: even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to you:
<br>Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.
<br>For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.
<br>Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.
<br>But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth, and fill it.
<br>Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sons with him,
<br>Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you:
<br>And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in all the beasts of the earth.
<br>I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the earth.
<br>And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which I give between me and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for perpetual generations.
<br>I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me, and between the earth.
<br>And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in the clouds:
<br>And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh.
<br>And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.
<br>And God said to Noe: This shall be the sign of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh upon the earth.
<br>And the sons of Noe who came out of the ark were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham is the father of Chanaan.
<br>These three are the sons of Noe: and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth.
<br>And Noe, a husbandman, began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard.
<br>And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.
<br>Which when Cham the father of Chanaan had seen, to wit, that his father's nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.
<br>But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
<br>And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him,
<br>He said: Cursed be Chanaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
<br>And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be Chanaan his servant.
<br>May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his servant.
<br>And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
<br>And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.<br>

<br>These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons were born after the flood.
<br>The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.
<br>And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.
<br>And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis, Cetthim and Dodanim.
<br>By these were divided the islands of the Gentiles in their lands, every one according to his tongue and their families in their nations.
<br>And the sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesram, and Phuth, and Chanaan.
<br>And the sons of Chus: Saba, and Hevila, and Sabatha, and Regma, and Sabathaca. And the sons of Regma: Saba, and Dadan.
<br>Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be mighty on the earth.
<br>And he was a stout hunter before the Lord. Hence came a proverb: Even as Nemrod, the stout hunter before the Lord.
<br>And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne in the land of Sennaar.
<br>Out of that land came forth Assur, and built Ninive, and the streets of the city, and Chale.
<br>Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this is the great city.
<br>And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Laabim, Nephthuim,
<br>And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom came forth the Philistines, and the Capthorim.
<br>And Chanaan begot Sidon, his firstborn, the Hethite,
<br>And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and the Gergesite,
<br>The Hevite, and the Aracite, the Sinite,
<br>The Aradian, and the Samarite, and the Hamathite: and afterwards the families of the Chanaanites were spread abroad.
<br>And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon as one comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou enter Sodom and Gomorrha, and Adama, and Seboim even to Lesa.
<br>These are the children of Cham in their kindreds, and tongues, and generations, and lands, and nations.
<br>Of Sem also the father of all the children of Heber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were born.
<br>The sons of Sem: Elam, and Assur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
<br>The sons of Aram: Us, and Hull, and Gether; and Mes.
<br>But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was born Heber.
<br>And to Heber were born two sons: the name of the one was Phaleg, because in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name Jectan.
<br>Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph, and Asarmoth, Jare,
<br>And Aduram, and Uzal, and Decla,
<br>And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,
<br>And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab. All these are the sons of Jectan.
<br>And their dwelling was from Messa as we go on as far as Sephar, a mountain in the east.
<br>These are the children of Sem according to their kindreds, and tongues, and countries, in their nations.
<br>These are the families of Noe, according to their people and nations. By these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood.

The New Testament portion was published in Reims, France, in 1582, in one volume with extensive commentary and notes. The Old Testament portion was published in two volumes twenty-seven years later in 1609 and 1610 by the University of Douai. The first volume, covering Genesis to Job, was published in 1609; the second, covering the Book of Psalms to 2 Maccabees (spelt "Machabees") plus the three apocryphal books of the Vulgate appendix following the Old Testament (Prayer of Manasseh, 3 Esdras, and 4 Esdras), was published in 1610. Marginal notes took up the bulk of the volumes and offered insights on issues of translation, and on the Hebrew and Greek source texts of the Vulgate.<br>The purpose of the version, both the text and notes, was to uphold Catholic tradition in the face of the Protestant Reformation which up until the time of its publication had dominated Elizabethan religion and academic debate. As such it was an effort by English Catholics to support the Counter-Reformation. The New Testament was reprinted in 1600, 1621 and 1633. The Old Testament volumes were reprinted in 1635 but neither thereafter for another hundred years. In 1589, William Fulke collated the complete Rheims text and notes in parallel columns with those of the Bishops' Bible. This work sold widely in England, being re-issued in three further editions to 1633. It was predominantly through Fulke's editions that the Rheims New Testament came to exercise a significant influence on the development of 17th-century English.<br>Much of the text of the 1582/1610 bible employed a densely Latinate vocabulary, making it extremely difficult to read the text in places. Consequently, this translation was replaced by a revision undertaken by bishop Richard Challoner; the New Testament in three editions of 1749, 1750, and 1752; the Old Testament (minus the Vulgate apocrypha), in 1750. Although retaining the title Douay–Rheims Bible, the Challoner revision (DRC) was a new version, tending to take as its base text the King James Version rigorously checked and extensively adjusted for improved readability and consistency with the Clementine edition of the Vulgate. Subsequent editions of the Challoner revision, of which there have been very many, reproduce his Old Testament of 1750 with very few changes. Challoner's New Testament was, however, extensively revised by Bernard MacMahon in a series of Dublin editions from 1783 to 1810. These Dublin versions are the source of some Challoner bibles printed in the United States in the 19th century. Subsequent editions of the Challoner Bible printed in England most often follow Challoner's earlier New Testament texts of 1749 and 1750, as do most 20th-century printings and online versions of the Douay–Rheims bible circulating on the internet.<br>Although the Jerusalem Bible, New American Bible Revised Edition, Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition, and New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition are the most commonly used Bibles in English-speaking Catholic churches, the Challoner revision of the Douay–Rheims often remains the Bible of choice of more-traditional English-speaking Catholics.]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Sacred Scripture/Douay-Rheims/Douay-Rheims.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Sacred Scripture/Douay-Rheims/Douay-Rheims.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 02:15:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Douay-Rheims]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>In principio creavit Deus cælum et terram.
<br>Terra autem erat inanis et vacua, et tenebræ erant super faciem abyssi: et spiritus Dei ferebatur super aquas.
<br>Dixitque Deus: Fiat lux. Et facta est lux.
<br>Et vidit Deus lucem quod esset bona: et divisit lucem a tenebris.
<br>Appellavitque lucem Diem, et tenebras Noctem: factumque est vespere et mane, dies unus.
<br>Dixit quoque Deus: Fiat firmamentum in medio aquarum: et dividat aquas ab aquis.
<br>Et fecit Deus firmamentum, divisitque aquas, quæ erant sub firmamento, ab his, quæ erant super firmamentum. Et factum est ita.
<br>Vocavitque Deus firmamentum, Cælum: et factum est vespere et mane, dies secundus.
<br>Dixit vero Deus: Congregentur aquæ, quæ sub cælo sunt, in locum unum: et appareat arida. Et factum est ita.
<br>Et vocavit Deus aridam Terram, congregationesque aquarum appellavit Maria. Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.
<br>Et ait: Germinet terra herbam virentem, et facientem semen, et lignum pomiferum faciens fructum juxta genus suum, cujus semen in semetipso sit super terram. Et factum est ita.
<br>Et protulit terra herbam virentem, et facientem semen juxta genus suum, lignumque faciens fructum, et habens unumquodque sementem secundum speciem suam. Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.
<br>Et factum est vespere et mane, dies tertius.
<br>Dixit autem Deus: Fiant luminaria in firmamento cæli, et dividant diem ac noctem, et sint in signa et tempora, et dies et annos:
<br>ut luceant in firmamento cæli, et illuminent terram. Et factum est ita.
<br>Fecitque Deus duo luminaria magna: luminare majus, ut præesset diei: et luminare minus, ut præesset nocti: et stellas.
<br>Et posuit eas in firmamento cæli, ut lucerent super terram,
<br>et præessent diei ac nocti, et dividerent lucem ac tenebras. Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.
<br>Et factum est vespere et mane, dies quartus.
<br>Dixit etiam Deus: Producant aquæ reptile animæ viventis, et volatile super terram sub firmamento cæli.
<br>Creavitque Deus cete grandia, et omnem animam viventem atque motabilem, quam produxerant aquæ in species suas, et omne volatile secundum genus suum. Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.
<br>Benedixitque eis, dicens: Crescite, et multiplicamini, et replete aquas maris: avesque multiplicentur super terram.
<br>Et factum est vespere et mane, dies quintus.
<br>Dixit quoque Deus: Producat terra animam viventem in genere suo, jumenta, et reptilia, et bestias terræ secundum species suas. Factumque est ita.
<br>Et fecit Deus bestias terræ juxta species suas, et jumenta, et omne reptile terræ in genere suo.<br>
Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum,
<br>et ait: Faciamus hominem ad imaginem et similitudinem nostram: et præsit piscibus maris, et volatilibus cæli, et bestiis, universæque terræ, omnique reptili, quod movetur in terra.
<br>Et creavit Deus hominem ad imaginem suam: ad imaginem Dei creavit illum, masculum et feminam creavit eos.
<br>Benedixitque illis Deus, et ait: Crescite et multiplicamini, et replete terram, et subjicite eam, et dominamini piscibus maris, et volatilibus cæli, et universis animantibus, quæ moventur super terram.
<br>Dixitque Deus: Ecce dedi vobis omnem herbam afferentem semen super terram, et universa ligna quæ habent in semetipsis sementem generis sui, ut sint vobis in escam:
<br>et cunctis animantibus terræ, omnique volucri cæli, et universis quæ moventur in terra, et in quibus est anima vivens, ut habeant ad vescendum. Et factum est ita.

<br>Complevitque Deus die septimo opus suum quod fecerat: et requievit die septimo ab universo opere quod patrarat.
<br>Et benedixit diei septimo, et sanctificavit illum, quia in ipso cessaverat ab omni opere suo quod creavit Deus ut faceret.  
<br>Istæ sunt generationes cæli et terræ, quando creata sunt, in die quo fecit Dominus Deus cælum et terram,

<br>Formavit igitur Dominus Deus hominem de limo terræ, et inspiravit in faciem ejus spiraculum vitæ, et factus est homo in animam viventem.

<br>Produxitque Dominus Deus de humo omne lignum pulchrum visu, et ad vescendum suave lignum etiam vitæ in medio paradisi, lignumque scientiæ boni et mali.

<br>et aurum terræ illius optimum est; ibi invenitur bdellium, et lapis onychinus.
<br>Et nomen fluvii secundi Gehon; ipse est qui circumit omnem terram Æthiopiæ.
<br>Nomen vero fluminis tertii, Tigris: ipse vadit contra Assyrios. Fluvius autem quartus, ipse est Euphrates.
<br>Tulit ergo Dominus Deus hominem, et posuit eum in paradiso voluptatis, ut operaretur, et custodiret illum:
<br>præcepitque ei, dicens: Ex omni ligno paradisi comede;
<br>de ligno autem scientiæ boni et mali ne comedas: in quocumque enim die comederis ex eo, morte morieris.
<br>Dixit quoque Dominus Deus: Non est bonum esse hominem solum: faciamus ei adjutorium simile sibi.
<br>Formatis igitur Dominus Deus de humo cunctis animantibus terræ, et universis volatilibus cæli, adduxit ea ad Adam, ut videret quid vocaret ea: omne enim quod vocavit Adam animæ viventis, ipsum est nomen ejus.
<br>Appellavitque Adam nominibus suis cuncta animantia, et universa volatilia cæli, et omnes bestias terræ: Adæ vero non inveniebatur adjutor similis ejus.
<br>Immisit ergo Dominus Deus soporem in Adam: cumque obdormisset, tulit unam de costis ejus, et replevit carnem pro ea.
<br>Et ædificavit Dominus Deus costam, quam tulerat de Adam, in mulierem: et adduxit eam ad Adam.
<br>Dixitque Adam: Hoc nunc os ex ossibus meis, et caro de carne mea: hæc vocabitur Virago, quoniam de viro sumpta est.
<br>Quam ob rem relinquet homo patrem suum, et matrem, et adhærebit uxori suæ: et erunt duo in carne una.
<br>Erat autem uterque nudus, Adam scilicet et uxor ejus: et non erubescebant.

<br>Sed et serpens erat callidior cunctis animantibus terræ quæ fecerat Dominus Deus. Qui dixit ad mulierem: Cur præcepit vobis Deus ut non comederetis de omni ligno paradisi?
<br>Cui respondit mulier: De fructu lignorum, quæ sunt in paradiso, vescimur:
<br>de fructu vero ligni quod est in medio paradisi, præcepit nobis Deus ne comederemus, et ne tangeremus illud, ne forte moriamur.
<br>Dixit autem serpens ad mulierem: Nequaquam morte moriemini.
<br>Scit enim Deus quod in quocumque die comederitis ex eo, aperientur oculi vestri, et eritis sicut dii, scientes bonum et malum.
<br>Vidit igitur mulier quod bonum esset lignum ad vescendum, et pulchrum oculis, aspectuque delectabile: et tulit de fructu illius, et comedit: deditque viro suo, qui comedit.
<br>Et aperti sunt oculi amborum; cumque cognovissent se esse nudos, consuerunt folia ficus, et fecerunt sibi perizomata.
<br>Et cum audissent vocem Domini Dei deambulantis in paradiso ad auram post meridiem, abscondit se Adam et uxor ejus a facie Domini Dei in medio ligni paradisi.
<br>Vocavitque Dominus Deus Adam, et dixit ei: Ubi es?
<br>Qui ait: Vocem tuam audivi in paradiso, et timui, eo quod nudus essem, et abscondi me.
<br>Cui dixit: Quis enim indicavit tibi quod nudus esses, nisi quod ex ligno de quo præceperam tibi ne comederes, comedisti?
<br>Dixitque Adam: Mulier, quam dedisti mihi sociam, dedit mihi de ligno, et comedi.
<br>Et dixit Dominus Deus ad mulierem: Quare hoc fecisti? Quæ respondit: Serpens decepit me, et comedi.  
<br>Et ait Dominus Deus ad serpentem: Quia fecisti hoc,<br>
maledictus es inter omnia animantia, et bestias terræ:<br>
super pectus tuum gradieris, et terram comedes cunctis diebus vitæ tuæ.  
<br>Inimicitias ponam inter te et mulierem,<br>
et semen tuum et semen illius:<br>
ipsa conteret caput tuum,<br>
et tu insidiaberis calcaneo ejus.
<br>Mulieri quoque dixit: Multiplicabo ærumnas tuas, et conceptus tuos: in dolore paries filios, et sub viri potestate eris, et ipse dominabitur tui.
<br>Adæ vero dixit: Quia audisti vocem uxoris tuæ, et comedisti de ligno, ex quo præceperam tibi ne comederes, maledicta terra in opere tuo: in laboribus comedes ex ea cunctis diebus vitæ tuæ.
<br>Spinas et tribulos germinabit tibi, et comedes herbam terræ.
<br>In sudore vultus tui vesceris pane, donec revertaris in terram de qua sumptus es: quia pulvis es et in pulverem reverteris.
<br>Et vocavit Adam nomen uxoris suæ, Heva: eo quod mater esset cunctorum viventium.
<br>Fecit quoque Dominus Deus Adæ et uxori ejus tunicas pelliceas, et induit eos:
<br>et ait: Ecce Adam quasi unus ex nobis factus est, sciens bonum et malum: nunc ergo ne forte mittat manum suam, et sumat etiam de ligno vitæ, et comedat, et vivat in æternum.
<br>Et emisit eum Dominus Deus de paradiso voluptatis, ut operaretur terram de qua sumptus est.
<br>Ejecitque Adam: et collocavit ante paradisum voluptatis cherubim, et flammeum gladium, atque versatilem, ad custodiendam viam ligni vitæ.

<br>Adam vero cognovit Evam uxorem suam, quae concepit et peperit Cain dicens: “Acquisivi virum per Dominum”.  
<br>Rursusque peperit fratrem eius Abel. Et fuit Abel pastor ovium et Cain agricola.  
<br>Factum est autem post aliquot dies ut offerret Cain de fructibus agri munus Domino.  
<br>Abel quoque obtulit de primogenitis gregis sui et de adipibus eorum. Et respexit Dominus ad Abel et ad munus eius,  
<br>ad Cain vero et ad munus illius non respexit. Iratusque est Cain vehementer, et concidit vultus eius.  
<br>Dixitque Dominus ad eum: “Quare iratus es, et cur concidit facies tua?  
<br>Nonne si bene egeris, vultum attolles? Sin autem male, in foribus peccatum insidiabitur, et ad te erit appetitus eius, tu autem dominaberis illius”.  
<br>Dixitque Cain ad Abel fratrem suum: “Egrediamur foras”. Cumque essent in agro, consurrexit Cain adversus Abel fratrem suum et interfecit eum.  
<br>Et ait Dominus ad Cain: “Ubi est Abel frater tuus?”. Qui respondit: “Nescio. Num custos fratris mei sum ego?”.  
<br>Dixitque ad eum: “Quid fecisti? Vox sanguinis fratris tui clamat ad me de agro.  
<br>Nunc igitur maledictus eris procul ab agro, qui aperuit os suum et suscepit sanguinem fratris tui de manu tua!  
<br>Cum operatus fueris eum, amplius non dabit tibi fructus suos; vagus et profugus eris super terram”.  
<br>Dixitque Cain ad Dominum: “Maior est poena mea quam ut portem eam.  
<br>Ecce eicis me hodie a facie agri, et a facie tua abscondar et ero vagus et profugus in terra; omnis igitur, qui invenerit me, occidet me”.  
<br>Dixitque ei Dominus: “Nequaquam ita fiet, sed omnis qui occiderit Cain, septuplum punietur!”. Posuitque Dominus Cain signum, ut non eum interficeret omnis qui invenisset eum.  
<br>Egressusque Cain a facie Domini habitavit in terra Nod ad orientalem plagam Eden.  
<br>Cognovit autem Cain uxorem suam, quae concepit et peperit Henoch. Et aedificavit civitatem vocavitque nomen eius ex nomine filii sui Henoch.  
<br>Porro Henoch genuit Irad, et Irad genuit Maviael, et Maviael genuit Mathusael, et Mathusael genuit Lamech.  
<br>Qui accepit uxores duas: nomen uni Ada et nomen alteri Sella.  
<br>Genuitque Ada Iabel, qui fuit pater habitantium in tentoriis atque pastorum.  
<br>Et nomen fratris eius Iubal; ipse fuit pater omnium canentium cithara et organo.  
<br>Sella quoque genuit Tubalcain, qui fuit malleator et faber in cuncta opera aeris et ferri. Soror vero Tubalcain Noema.  
<br>Dixitque Lamech uxoribus suis:<br>
“Ada et Sella, audite vocem meam; uxores Lamech, auscultate sermonem meum:<br>
occidi virum pro vulnere meo<br>
et adulescentulum pro livore meo;  
<br>septuplum ultio dabitur de Cain, de Lamech vero septuagies septies”.  
<br>Cognovit quoque Adam uxorem suam, et peperit filium vocavitque nomen eius Seth dicens: “Posuit mihi Deus semen aliud pro Abel, quem occidit Cain”.  
<br>Sed et Seth natus est filius, quem vocavit Enos. Tunc coeperunt invocare nomen Domini.

<br>Cumque coepissent homines multiplicari super terram et filias procreassent,  
<br>videntes filii Dei filias hominum quod essent pulchrae, acceperunt sibi uxores ex omnibus, quas elegerant.  
<br>Dixitque Deus: “Non permanebit spiritus meus in homine in aeternum, quia caro est; eruntque dies illius centum viginti annorum”.  
<br>Gigantes erant super terram in diebus illis et etiam postquam ingressi sunt filii Dei ad filias hominum, illaeque eis genuerunt: isti sunt potentes a saeculo viri famosi.  
<br>Videns autem Dominus quod multa malitia hominum esset in terra, et cuncta cogitatio cordis eorum non intenta esset nisi ad malum omni tempore,  
<br>paenituit Dominum quod hominem fecisset in terra. Et tactus dolore cordis intrinsecus:  
<br>“Delebo, inquit, hominem, quem creavi, a facie terrae, ab homine usque ad pecus, usque ad reptile et usque ad volucres caeli; paenitet enim me fecisse eos”.  
<br>Noe vero invenit gratiam coram Domino.  
<br>Hae sunt generationes Noe: Noe vir iustus atque perfectus fuit in generatione sua; cum Deo ambulavit.  
<br>Et genuit tres filios: Sem, Cham et Iapheth.  
<br>Corrupta est autem terra coram Deo et repleta est iniquitate.  
<br>Cumque vidisset Deus terram esse corruptam ­ omnis quippe caro corruperat viam suam super terram ­  
<br>dixit ad Noe: “Finis universae carnis venit coram me; repleta est enim terra iniquitate a facie eorum, et ecce ego disperdam eos de terra.  
<br>Fac tibi arcam de lignis cupressinis; mansiunculas in arca facies et bitumine linies eam intrinsecus et extrinsecus.  
<br>Et sic facies eam: trecentorum cubitorum erit longitudo arcae, quinquaginta cubitorum latitudo et triginta cubitorum altitudo illius.  
<br>Fenestram in arca facies et cubito consummabis summitatem eius. Ostium autem arcae pones ex latere; tabulatum inferius, medium et superius facies in ea.  
<br>Ecce ego adducam diluvii aquas super terram, ut interficiam omnem carnem, in qua spiritus vitae est subter caelum: universa, quae in terra sunt, consumentur.  
<br>Ponamque foedus meum tecum; et ingredieris arcam tu et filii tui, uxor tua et uxores filiorum tuorum tecum.  
<br>Et ex cunctis animantibus universae carnis bina induces in arcam, ut vivant tecum, masculini sexus et feminini.  
<br>De volucribus iuxta genus suum et de iumentis in genere suo et ex omni reptili terrae secundum genus suum: bina de omnibus ingredientur ad te, ut possint vivere.  
<br>Tu autem tolle tecum ex omnibus escis, quae mandi possunt, et comportabis apud te; et erunt tam tibi quam illis in cibum”.  
<br>Fecit ergo Noe omnia, quae praeceperat illi Deus; sic fecit.

<br>Ex omnibus pecoribus mundis tolle septena septena, masculum et feminam; de pecoribus vero non mundis duo duo, masculum et feminam.  
<br>Sed et de volatilibus caeli septena septena, masculum et feminam, ut salvetur semen super faciem universae terrae.  
<br>Adhuc enim et post dies septem ego pluam super terram quadraginta diebus et quadraginta noctibus et delebo omnem substantiam, quam feci, de superficie terrae”.  
<br>Fecit ergo Noe omnia, quae mandaverat ei Dominus.  
<br>Eratque Noe sescentorum annorum, quando diluvii aquae inundaverunt super terram.  
<br>Et ingressus est Noe et filii eius, uxor eius et uxores filiorum eius cum eo in arcam propter aquas diluvii.  
<br>De pecoribus mundis et immundis et de volucribus et ex omni, quod movetur super terram,  
<br>duo et duo ingressa sunt ad Noe in arcam, masculus et femina, sicut praeceperat Deus Noe.  
<br>Cumque transissent septem dies, aquae diluvii inundaverunt super terram.  
<br>Anno sescentesimo vitae Noe, mense secundo, septimo decimo die mensis rupti sunt omnes fontes abyssi magnae, et cataractae caeli apertae sunt;  
<br>et facta est pluvia super terram quadraginta diebus et quadraginta noctibus.  
<br>In articulo diei illius ingressus est Noe et Sem et Cham et Iapheth filii eius, uxor illius et tres uxores filiorum eius cum eis in arcam.  
<br>Ipsi et omne animal secundum genus suum, universaque iumenta in genere suo, et omne reptile, quod movetur super terram in genere suo, cunctumque volatile secundum genus suum, universae aves omnesque volucres  
<br>ingressae sunt ad Noe in arcam, bina et bina ex omni carne, in qua erat spiritus vitae.  
<br>Et quae ingressa sunt, masculus et femina ex omni carne introierunt, sicut praeceperat ei Deus; et inclusit eum Dominus de foris.  
<br>Factumque est diluvium quadraginta diebus super terram, et multiplicatae sunt aquae et elevaverunt arcam in sublime a terra.  
<br>Vehementer enim inundaverunt et omnia repleverunt in superficie terrae; porro arca ferebatur super aquas.  
<br>Et aquae praevaluerunt nimis super terram, opertique sunt omnes montes excelsi sub universo caelo.  
<br>Quindecim cubitis altior fuit aqua super montes, quos operuerat.  
<br>Consumptaque est omnis caro, quae movebatur super terram, volucrum, pecorum, bestiarum omniumque reptilium, quae reptant super terram, et universi homines:  
<br>cuncta, in quibus spiraculum vitae in terra, mortua sunt.  
<br>Et delevit omnem substantiam, quae erat super terram, ab homine usque ad pecus, usque ad reptile et usque ad volucres caeli; et deleta sunt de terra. Remansit autem solus Noe et qui cum eo erant in arca.

<br>Recordatus autem Deus Noe cunctorumque animantium et omnium iumentorum, quae erant cum eo in arca, adduxit spiritum super terram, et imminutae sunt aquae.  
<br>Et clausi sunt fontes abyssi et cataractae caeli, et prohibitae sunt pluviae de caelo.  
<br>Reversaeque sunt aquae de terra euntes et redeuntes et coeperunt minui post centum quinquaginta dies.  
<br>Requievitque arca mense septimo, decima septima die mensis super montes Ararat.  
<br>At vero aquae ibant et decrescebant usque ad decimum mensem; decimo enim mense, prima die mensis, apparuerunt cacumina montium.  
<br>Cumque transissent quadraginta dies, aperiens Noe fenestram arcae, quam fecerat, dimisit corvum;  
<br>qui egrediebatur exiens et rediens, donec siccarentur aquae super terram.  
<br>Emisit quoque columbam a se, ut videret si iam cessassent aquae super faciem terrae.  
<br>Quae, cum non invenisset, ubi requiesceret pes eius, reversa est ad eum in arcam; aquae enim erant super universam terram. Extenditque manum et apprehensam intulit in arcam.  
<br>Exspectatis autem ultra septem diebus aliis, rursum dimisit columbam ex arca.  
<br>At illa venit ad eum ad vesperam portans ramum olivae virentibus foliis in ore suo. Intellexit ergo Noe quod cessassent aquae super terram.  
<br>Exspectavitque nihilominus septem alios dies; et emisit columbam, quae non est reversa ultra ad eum.  
<br>Igitur sescentesimo primo anno, primo mense, prima die mensis, siccatae sunt aquae super terram; et aperiens Noe tectum arcae, et ecce aspexit viditque quod exsiccata erat superficies terrae.  
<br>Mense secundo, septima et vicesima die mensis, arefacta est terra.  
<br>Locutus est autem Deus ad Noe dicens:  
<br>“Egredere de arca tu et uxor tua, filii tui et uxores filiorum tuorum tecum.  
<br>Cuncta animantia, quae sunt apud te ex omni carne, tam in volatilibus quam in pecoribus et in universis reptilibus, quae reptant super terram, educ tecum, ut pullulent super terram et crescant et multiplicentur super eam”.  
<br>Egressus est ergo Noe et filii eius, uxor illius et uxores filiorum eius cum eo.  
<br>Sed et omnia animantia, iumenta, volatilia et reptilia, quae reptant super terram, secundum genus suum egressa sunt de arca.  
<br>Aedificavit autem Noe altare Domino; et tollens de cunctis pecoribus mundis et volucribus mundis obtulit holocausta super altare.  
<br>Odoratusque est Dominus odorem suavitatis et locutus est Dominus ad cor suum: “Nequaquam ultra maledicam terrae propter homines, quia cogitatio humani cordis in malum prona est ab adulescentia sua. Non igitur ultra percutiam omnem animam viventem, sicut feci.  
<br>Cunctis diebus terrae, sementis et messis, frigus et aestus, aestas et hiems, dies et nox non requiescent”.

<br>Et terror vester ac tremor sit super cuncta animalia terrae et super omnes volucres caeli cum universis, quae moventur super terram; omnes pisces maris manui vestrae traditi sunt.  
<br>Omne, quod movetur et vivit, erit vobis in cibum; quasi holera virentia tradidi vobis omnia,

<br>arcum meum ponam in nubibus, et erit signum foederis inter me et inter terram.  
<br>Cumque obduxero nubibus caelum, apparebit arcus meus in nubibus,  
<br>et recordabor foederis mei vobiscum et cum omni anima vivente, quae carnem vegetat; et non erunt ultra aquae diluvii ad delendum universam carnem.  
<br>Eritque arcus in nubibus, et videbo illum et recordabor foederis sempiterni, quod pactum est inter Deum et omnem animam viventem universae carnis, quae est super terram”.  
<br>Dixitque Deus ad Noe: “Hoc erit signum foederis, quod constitui inter me et omnem carnem super terram”.  
<br>Erant ergo filii Noe, qui egressi sunt de arca, Sem, Cham et Iapheth. Porro Cham ipse est pater Chanaan.  
<br>Tres isti filii sunt Noe, et ab his disseminatum est omne hominum genus super universam terram.  
<br>Coepitque Noe agricola plantare vineam;  
<br>bibensque vinum inebriatus est et nudatus in tabernaculo suo.  
<br>Quod cum vidisset Cham pater Chanaan, verenda scilicet patris sui esse nudata, nuntiavit duobus fratribus suis foras.  
<br>At vero Sem et Iapheth pallium imposuerunt umeris suis et incedentes retrorsum operuerunt verecunda patris sui, faciesque eorum aversae erant, et patris virilia non viderunt.  
<br>Evigilans autem Noe ex vino, cum didicisset, quae fecerat ei filius suus minor,  
<br>ait:<br>
Maledictus Chanaan!<br>
Servus servorum erit fratribus suis”.  
<br>Dixitque:<br>
Benedictus Dominus Deus Sem!<br>
Sitque Chanaan servus eius.  
<br>Dilatet Deus Iapheth,<br>
et habitet in tabernaculis Sem,<br>
sitque Chanaan servus eius”.  
<br>Vixit autem Noe post diluvium trecentis quinquaginta annis.  
<br>Et impleti sunt omnes dies eius nongentorum quinquaginta annorum, et mortuus est.

<br>Hae sunt generationes filiorum Noe, Sem, Cham et Iapheth; natique sunt eis filii post diluvium.  
<br>Filii Iapheth: Gomer et Magog et Madai et Iavan et Thubal et Mosoch et Thiras.  
<br>Porro filii Gomer: Aschenez et Riphath et Thogorma.  
<br>Filii autem Iavan: Elisa et Tharsis, Cetthim et Rodanim.  
<br>Ab his divisae sunt insulae gentium in regionibus suis, unusquisque secundum linguam suam et familias suas in nationibus suis.  
<br>Filii autem Cham: Chus et Mesraim et Phut et Chanaan.  
<br>Filii Chus: Saba et Hevila et Sabatha et Regma et Sabathacha. Filii Regma: Saba et Dedan.  
<br>Porro Chus genuit Nemrod: ipse coepit esse potens in terra  
<br>et erat robustus venator coram Domino. Ob hoc exivit proverbium: “Quasi Nemrod robustus venator coram Domino”.  
<br>Fuit autem principium regni eius Babylon et Arach et Achad et Chalanne in terra Sennaar.  
<br>De terra illa egressus est in Assyriam et aedificavit Nineven et Rohobothir et Chale,  
<br>Resen quoque inter Nineven et Chale; haec est civitas magna.  
<br>At vero Mesraim genuit Ludim et Anamim et Laabim, Nephthuim  
<br>et Phetrusim et Chasluim et Caphtorim, de quibus egressi sunt Philisthim.  
<br>Chanaan autem genuit Sidonem primogenitum suum, Hetthaeum  
<br>et Iebusaeum et Amorraeum, Gergesaeum,  
<br>Hevaeum et Aracaeum, Sinaeum  
<br>et Aradium, Samaraeum et Emathaeum; et post haec disseminati sunt populi Chananaeorum.  
<br>Factique sunt termini Chanaan venientibus a Sidone Geraram usque Gazam, donec ingrediaris Sodomam et Gomorram et Adamam et Seboim usque Lesa.  
<br>Hi sunt filii Cham in cognationibus et linguis terrisque et gentibus suis.  
<br>De Sem quoque nati sunt, patre omnium filiorum Heber, fratre Iapheth maiore.  
<br>Filii Sem: Elam et Assur et Arphaxad et Lud et Aram.  
<br>Filii Aram: Us et Hul et Gether et Mes.  
<br>At vero Arphaxad genuit Sala, de quo ortus est Heber.  
<br>Natique sunt Heber filii duo: nomen uni Phaleg, eo quod in diebus eius divisa sit terra, et nomen fratris eius Iectan.  
<br>Qui Iectan genuit Elmodad et Saleph et Asarmoth, Iare  
<br>et Adoram et Uzal et Decla  
<br>et Ebal et Abimael, Saba  
<br>et Ophir et Hevila et Iobab. Omnes isti filii Iectan;  
<br>et facta est habitatio eorum de Messa pergentibus usque Sephar montem orientalem.  
<br>Isti filii Sem secundum cognationes et linguas et regiones in gentibus suis.  
<br>Hae familiae filiorum Noe iuxta generationes et nationes suas. Ab his divisae sunt gentes in terra post diluvium.

<br>Erat autem universa terra labii unius et sermonum eorundem.  
<br>Cumque proficiscerentur de oriente, invenerunt campum in terra Sennaar et habitaverunt in eo.  
<br>Dixitque alter ad proximum suum: “Venite, faciamus lateres et coquamus eos igni”. Habueruntque lateres pro saxis et bitumen pro caemento.  
<br>Et dixerunt: “Venite, faciamus nobis civitatem et turrim, cuius culmen pertingat ad caelum, et faciamus nobis nomen, ne dividamur super faciem universae terrae”.  
<br>Descendit autem Dominus, ut videret civitatem et turrim, quam aedificaverunt filii hominum,  
<br>et dixit Dominus: “Ecce unus est populus et unum labium omnibus; et hoc est initium operationis eorum, nec eis erit deinceps difficile, quidquid cogitaverint facere.  
<br>Venite igitur, descendamus et confundamus ibi linguam eorum, ut non intellegat unusquisque vocem proximi sui”.  
<br>Atque ita divisit eos Dominus ex illo loco super faciem universae terrae, et cessaverunt aedificare civitatem.  
<br>Et idcirco vocatum est nomen eius Babel, quia ibi confusum est labium universae terrae, et inde dispersit eos Dominus super faciem universae terrae.  
<br>Hae sunt generationes Sem. Sem centum erat annorum, quando genuit Arphaxad biennio post diluvium;  
<br>vixitque Sem, postquam genuit Arphaxad, quingentos annos et genuit filios et filias.  
<br>Porro Arphaxad vixit triginta quinque annos et genuit Sala.  
<br>Vixitque Arphaxad, postquam genuit Sala, quadringentis tribus annis et genuit filios et filias.  
<br>Sala quoque vixit triginta annis et genuit Heber.  
<br>Vixitque Sala, postquam genuit Heber, quadringentis tribus annis et genuit filios et filias.  
<br>Vixit autem Heber triginta quattuor annis et genuit Phaleg.  
<br>Et vixit Heber, postquam genuit Phaleg, quadringentis triginta annis et genuit filios et filias.  
<br>Vixit quoque Phaleg triginta annis et genuit Reu.  
<br>Vixitque Phaleg, postquam genuit Reu, ducentis novem annis et genuit filios et filias.  
<br>Vixit autem Reu triginta duobus annis et genuit Seruch.  
<br>Vixitque Reu, postquam genuit Seruch, ducentis septem annis et genuit filios et filias.  
<br>Vixit vero Seruch triginta annis et genuit Nachor.  
<br>Vixitque Seruch, postquam genuit Nachor, ducentos annos et genuit filios et filias.  
<br>Vixit autem Nachor viginti novem annis et genuit Thare.  
<br>Vixitque Nachor, postquam genuit Thare, centum decem et novem annos et genuit filios et filias.  
<br>Vixitque Thare septuaginta annis et genuit Abram, Nachor et Aran.  
<br>Hae sunt autem generationes Thare. Thare genuit Abram, Nachor et Aran. Porro Aran genuit Lot;  
<br>mortuusque est Aran ante Thare patrem suum in terra nativitatis suae in Ur Chaldaeorum.  
<br>Duxerunt autem Abram et Nachor uxores: nomen uxoris Abram Sarai, et nomen uxoris Nachor Melcha, filia Aran patris Melchae et patris Ieschae.  
<br>Erat autem Sarai sterilis nec habebat liberos.  
<br>Tulitque Thare Abram filium suum et Lot filium Aran filium filii sui et Sarai nurum suam, uxorem Abram filii sui, et eduxit eos de Ur Chaldaeorum, ut irent in terram Chanaan. Veneruntque usque Charran et habitaverunt ibi.  
<br>Et facti sunt dies Thare ducentorum quinque annorum, et mortuus est in Charran.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Dixit autem Dominus ad Abram:<br>
“Egredere de terra tua et de cognatione tua<br>
et de domo patris tui<br>
in terram, quam monstrabo tibi.  
<br>Faciamque te in gentem magnam<br>
et benedicam tibi<br>
et magnificabo nomen tuum,<br>
erisque in benedictionem.  
<br>Benedicam benedicentibus tibi<br>
et maledicentibus tibi maledicam,<br>
atque in te benedicentur<br>
universae cognationes terrae!”.  
<br>Egressus est itaque Abram, sicut praeceperat ei Dominus, et ivit cum eo Lot. Septuaginta quinque annorum erat Abram, cum egrederetur de Charran.  
<br>Tulitque Sarai uxorem suam et Lot filium fratris sui universamque substantiam, quam acquisiverant, et animas, quas fecerant in Charran, et egressi sunt, ut irent in terram Chanaan; et venerunt in terram Chanaan.  
<br>Pertransivit Abram terram usque ad locum Sichem, usque ad Quercum Moreh. Chananaeus autem tunc erat in terra.  
<br>Apparuit autem Dominus Abram et dixit ei: “Semini tuo dabo terram hanc”. Qui aedificavit ibi altare Domino, qui apparuerat ei.  
<br>Et inde transgrediens ad montem, qui erat contra orientem Bethel, tetendit ibi tabernaculum suum ab occidente habens Bethel et ab oriente Hai; aedificavit quoque ibi altare Domino et invocavit nomen Domini.  
<br>Perrexitque Abram de mansione in mansionem usque ad Nageb.  
<br>Facta est autem fames in terra; descenditque Abram in Aegyptum, ut peregrinaretur ibi; praevaluerat enim fames in terra.  
<br>Cumque prope esset, ut ingrederetur Aegyptum, dixit Sarai uxori suae: “Novi quod pulchra sis mulier  
<br>et quod, cum viderint te Aegyptii, dicturi sunt: "Uxor ipsius est"; et interficient me et te reservabunt.  
<br>Dic ergo, obsecro te, quod soror mea sis, ut bene sit mihi propter te, et vivat anima mea ob gratiam tui”.  
<br>Cum itaque ingressus esset Abram Aegyptum, viderunt Aegyptii mulierem quod esset pulchra nimis,  
<br>et viderunt eam principes pharaonis et laudaverunt eam apud illum; et sublata est mulier in domum pharaonis.  
<br>Abram vero bene usus est propter illam; fueruntque ei oves et boves et asini et servi et famulae et asinae et cameli.  
<br>Flagellavit autem Dominus pharaonem plagis maximis et domum eius propter Sarai uxorem Abram.  
<br>Vocavitque pharao Abram et dixit ei: “Quidnam est hoc quod fecisti mihi? Quare non indicasti mihi quod uxor tua esset?  
<br>Quam ob causam dixisti esse sororem tuam, ut tollerem eam mihi in uxorem? Nunc igitur, ecce coniux tua: accipe eam et vade!”.  
<br>Praecepitque pharao super Abram viris; et deduxerunt eum et uxorem illius et omnia, quae habebat.

<br>Ascendit ergo Abram de Aegypto ipse et uxor eius et omnia, quae habebat, et Lot cum eo ad Nageb.  
<br>Abram autem erat dives valde in pecoribus, argento et auro.  
<br>Et profectus est de mansione in mansionem a Nageb in Bethel usque ad locum, ubi prius fixerat tabernaculum inter Bethel et Hai,  
<br>in loco altaris, quod fecerat prius, et invocavit ibi nomen Domini.  
<br>Sed et Lot, qui ibat cum Abram, fuerunt greges ovium et armenta et tabernacula;  
<br>nec poterat eos capere terra, ut habitarent simul: erat quippe substantia eorum multa, et nequibant habitare communiter.  
<br>Unde et facta est rixa inter pastores gregum Abram et pastores gregum Lot. Eo autem tempore Chananaeus et Pherezaeus habitabant in illa terra.  
<br>Dixit ergo Abram ad Lot: “Ne, quaeso, sit iurgium inter me et te et inter pastores meos et pastores tuos: fratres enim sumus.  
<br>Nonne universa terra coram te est? Recede a me, obsecro: si ad sinistram ieris, ego dexteram tenebo; si tu dexteram elegeris, ego ad sinistram pergam”.  
<br>Elevatis itaque Lot oculis, vidit omnem circa regionem Iordanis, quae universa irrigabatur, antequam subverteret Dominus Sodomam et Gomorram, sicut paradisus Domini et sicut Aegyptus usque in Segor.  
<br>Elegitque sibi Lot omnem regionem circa Iordanem et recessit ad orientem; divisique sunt alterutrum a fratre suo.  
<br>Abram habitavit in terra Chanaan; Lot vero moratus est in oppidis, quae erant circa Iordanem, et tabernacula movit usque ad Sodomam.  
<br>Homines autem Sodomitae pessimi erant et peccatores coram Domino nimis.  
<br>Dixitque Dominus ad Abram, postquam divisus est Lot ab eo: “Leva oculos tuos et vide a loco, in quo nunc es, ad aquilonem et ad meridiem, ad orientem et ad occidentem:  
<br>omnem terram, quam conspicis, tibi dabo et semini tuo usque in sempiternum;  
<br>faciamque semen tuum sicut pulverem terrae: si quis potest hominum numerare pulverem terrae, semen quoque tuum numerare poterit.  
<br>Surge et perambula terram in longitudine et in latitudine sua, quia tibi daturus sum eam”.  
<br>Movens igitur tabernaculum suum, Abram venit et habitavit iuxta Quercus Mambre, quae sunt in Hebron, aedificavitque ibi altare Domino.

<br>Factum est autem in illo tempore, ut Amraphel rex Sennaar et Arioch rex Ellasar et Chodorlahomor rex Elam et Thadal rex gentium  
<br>inirent bellum contra Bara regem Sodomae et contra Bersa regem Gomorrae et contra Sennaab regem Adamae et contra Semeber regem Seboim contraque regem Belae; ipsa est Segor.  
<br>Omnes hi convenerunt in vallem Siddim, quae nunc est mare Salis.  
<br>Duodecim annis servierant Chodorlahomor et tertio decimo anno recesserunt ab eo.  
<br>Igitur anno quarto decimo venit Chodorlahomor et reges, qui erant cum eo, percusseruntque Raphaim in Astharothcarnaim et Zuzim in Ham et Emim in Savecariathaim  
<br>et Chorraeos in montibus Seir usque ad Elpharan, quae est in deserto.  
<br>Reversique sunt et venerunt ad fontem Mesphat; ipsa est Cades. Et percusserunt omnem regionem Amalecitarum et etiam Amorraeum, qui habitabat in Asasonthamar.  
<br>Et egressi sunt rex Sodomae et rex Gomorrae rexque Adamae et rex Seboim necnon et rex Belae, quae est Segor; et direxerunt contra eos aciem in valle Siddim,  
<br>scilicet adversus Chodorlahomor regem Elam et Thadal regem gentium et Amraphel regem Sennaar et Arioch regem Ellasar: quattuor reges adversus quinque.  
<br>Vallis autem Siddim habebat puteos multos bituminis. Itaque rex Sodomae et Gomorrae terga verterunt cecideruntque illuc; et, qui remanserant, fugerunt ad montem.  
<br>Tulerunt autem omnem substantiam Sodomae et Gomorrae et universa, quae ad cibum pertinent, et abierunt;  
<br>ceperunt et Lot et substantiam eius, filium fratris Abram, qui habitabat in Sodoma.  
<br>Et ecce unus, qui evaserat, nuntiavit Abram Hebraeo, qui habitabat iuxta Quercus Mambre Amorraei fratris Eschol et fratris Aner; hi enim pepigerant foedus cum Abram.  
<br>Quod cum audisset Abram, captum videlicet Lot fratrem suum, numeravit expeditos vernaculos suos trecentos decem et octo et persecutus est usque Dan;  
<br>et, divisis sociis, irruit super eos nocte percussitque eos et persecutus est eos usque Hoba, quae est ad laevam Damasci;  
<br>reduxitque omnem substantiam, necnon et Lot fratrem suum cum substantia illius, mulieres quoque et populum.  
<br>Egressus est autem rex Sodomae in occursum eius, postquam reversus est a caede Chodorlahomor et regum, qui cum eo erant, in vallem Save, quae est vallis Regis.  
<br>At vero Melchisedech rex Salem proferens panem et vinum ­ erat enim sacerdos Dei altissimi 
<br>benedixit ei et ait:<br>
“Benedictus Abram a Deo excelso, qui creavit caelum et terram  
<br>et benedictus Deus excelsus,<br>
qui tradidit hostes tuos in manus tuas”.<br>
Et dedit ei decimas ex omnibus.  
<br>Dixit autem rex Sodomae ad Abram: “Da mihi animas; substantiam tolle tibi”.  
<br>Qui respondit ei: “Levo manum meam ad Dominum, Deum excelsum, creatorem caeli et terrae,  
<br>a filo subteminis usque ad corrigiam caligae non accipiam ex omnibus, quae tua sunt, ne dicas: "Ego ditavi Abram";

<br>His itaque transactis, factus est sermo Domini ad Abram per visionem dicens: “Noli timere, Abram! Ego protector tuus sum, et merces tua magna erit nimis”.
<br>Dixitque Abram: “Domine Deus, quid dabis mihi? Ego vadam absque liberis, et heres domus meae erit Damascenus Eliezer ”.
<br>Addiditque Abram: “En mihi non dedisti semen, et ecce vernaculus meus heres meus erit”.
<br>Sed ecce sermo Domini factus est ad eum: “Non erit hic heres tuus, sed qui egredietur de visceribus tuis, ipsum habebis heredem ”.
<br>Eduxitque eum foras et ait illi: “Suspice caelum et numera stellas, si potes”. Et dixit ei: “Sic erit semen tuum”.
<br>Credidit Domino, et reputatum est ei ad iustitiam.
<br>Dixitque ad eum: “Ego Dominus, qui eduxi te de Ur Chaldaeorum, ut darem tibi terram istam, et possideres eam”.
<br>Et ille ait: “Domine Deus, unde scire possum quod possessurus sim eam?”.
<br>Respondens Dominus: “Sume, inquit, mihi vitulam triennem et capram trimam et arietem annorum trium, turturem quoque et columbam”.
<br>Qui tollens universa haec divisit ea per medium et utrasque partes contra se altrinsecus posuit; aves autem non divisit.
<br>Descenderuntque volucres super cadavera, et abigebat eas Abram.
<br>Cumque sol occumberet, sopor irruit super Abram, et ecce horror magnus et tenebrosus invasit eum.
<br>Dictumque est ad eum: “Scito praenoscens quod peregrinum futurum sit semen tuum in terra non sua, et subicient eos servituti et affligent quadringentis annis.
<br>Verumtamen et gentem, cui servituri sunt, ego iudicabo, et post haec egredientur cum magna substantia.
<br>Tu autem ibis ad patres tuos in pace, sepultus in senectute bona.
<br>Generatione autem quarta revertentur huc; necdum enim completae sunt iniquitates Amorraeorum usque ad praesens tempus”.
<br>Cum ergo occubuisset sol, facta est caligo tenebrosa, et apparuit clibanus fumans et lampas ignis transiens inter divisiones illas.
<br>In illo die pepigit Dominus cum Abram foedus dicens: “Semini tuo dabo terram hanc a fluvio Aegypti usque ad magnum fluvium Euphraten,
<br>Cinaeos et Cenezaeos, Cedmonaeos
<br>et Hetthaeos et Pherezaeos, Raphaim quoque
<br>et Amorraeos et Chananaeos et Gergesaeos et Iebusaeos”.

<br>Sarai autem uxor Abram non genuerat ei liberos; sed habens ancillam Aegyptiam nomine Agar,
<br>dixit marito suo: “Ecce conclusit me Dominus, ne parerem; ingredere ad ancillam meam, si forte saltem ex illa suscipiam filios”. Cumque ille acquiesceret deprecanti,
<br>tulit Agar Aegyptiam ancillam suam post annos decem quam habitare coeperant in terra Chanaan, et dedit eam viro suo uxorem.
<br>Qui ingressus est ad eam. At illa concepisse se videns despexit dominam suam.
<br>Dixitque Sarai ad Abram: “Inique agis contra me; ego dedi ancillam meam in sinum tuum, quae videns quod conceperit, despectui me habet. Iudicet Dominus inter me et te”.
<br>Cui respondens Abram: “Ecce, ait, ancilla tua in manu tua est; utere ea, ut libet”. Affligente igitur eam Sarai, aufugit ab ea.
<br>Cumque invenisset illam angelus Domini iuxta fontem aquae in deserto, ad fontem in via Sur,
<br>dixit: “ Agar, ancilla Sarai, unde venis et quo vadis? ”. Quae respondit: “ A facie Sarai dominae meae ego fugio ”.
<br>Dixitque ei angelus Domini: “ Revertere ad dominam tuam et humiliare sub manibus ipsius ”. 
<br>Et dixit ei angelus Domini: “ Multiplicans multiplicabo semen tuum, et non numerabitur prae multitudine ”. 
<br>Et dixit ei angelus Domini:<br>
“ Ecce, concepisti et paries filium<br>
vocabisque nomen eius Ismael,<br>
eo quod audierit Dominus afflictionem tuam.
<br>Hic erit homo onagro similis;<br>
manus eius contra omnes,<br>
et manus omnium contra eum;<br>
et e regione universorum fratrum suorum figet tabernacula ”.
<br>Vocavit autem nomen Domini, qui loquebatur ad eam: “ Tu Deus, qui vidisti me ”. Dixit enim: “ Profecto hic vidi posteriora videntis me ”. 
<br>Propterea appellatur puteus ille Lahairoi (id est Viventis et Videntis me); ipse est inter Cades et Barad.

<br>Postquam Abram nonaginta et novem annorum factus est, apparuit ei Dominus dixitque ad eum: “Ego Deus omnipotens, ambula coram me et esto perfectus.
<br>Ponamque foedus meum inter me et te et multiplicabo te vehementer nimis”.
<br>Cecidit Abram pronus in faciem.
<br>Dixitque ei Deus: “Ecce pactum meum tecum. Erisque pater multarum gentium,
<br>nec ultra vocabitur nomen tuum Abram, sed Abraham erit nomen tuum, quia patrem multarum gentium constitui te.
<br>Faciamque te crescere vehementissime et ponam te in gentes; regesque ex te egredientur.
<br>Et statuam pactum meum inter me et te et inter semen tuum post te in generationibus suis foedere sempiterno, ut sim Deus tuus et seminis tui post te.
<br>Daboque tibi et semini tuo post te terram peregrinationis tuae, omnem terram Chanaan in possessionem aeternam; eroque Deus eorum”.
<br>Dixit iterum Deus ad Abraham: “Tu autem pactum meum custodies, et semen tuum post te in generationibus suis.
<br>Hoc est pactum meum, quod observabitis, inter me et vos et semen tuum post te. Circumcidetur ex vobis omne masculinum,
<br>et circumcidetis carnem praeputii vestri, ut sit in signum foederis inter me et vos.
<br>Infans octo dierum circumcidetur in vobis: omne masculinum in generationibus vestris, tam vernaculus quam empticius ex omnibus alienigenis, quicumque non fuerit de stirpe vestra.
<br>Circumcidetur vernaculus et empticius, eritque pactum meum in carne vestra in foedus aeternum. 14 Masculus, cuius praeputii caro circumcisa non fuerit, delebitur anima illa de populo suo; pactum meum irritum fecit”.
<br>Dixit quoque Deus ad Abraham: “Sarai uxorem tuam non vocabis nomen eius Sarai, sed Sara erit nomen eius.
<br>Et benedicam ei; et ex illa quoque dabo tibi filium. Benedicturus sum eam, eritque in nationes; reges populorum orientur ex ea”.
<br>Cecidit Abraham in faciem suam et risit dicens in corde suo: “Putasne centenario nascetur filius? Et Sara nonagenaria pariet?”.
<br>Dixitque ad Deum: “Utinam Ismael vivat coram te”.
<br>Et ait Deus: “Sara uxor tua pariet tibi filium, vocabisque nomen eius Isaac; et constituam pactum meum illi in foedus sempiternum et semini eius post eum.
<br>Super Ismael quoque exaudivi te: ecce benedicam ei et crescere faciam et multiplicabo eum vehementissime; duodecim duces generabit, et faciam illum in gentem magnam.
<br>Pactum vero meum statuam ad Isaac, quem pariet tibi Sara tempore isto in anno altero”.
<br>Cumque cessasset loqui cum eo, ascendit Deus ab Abraham.
<br>Tulit ergo Abraham Ismael filium suum et omnes vernaculos domus suae universosque, quos emerat: cunctos mares ex omnibus viris domus suae; et circumcidit carnem praeputii eorum statim in ipsa die, sicut praeceperat ei Deus.
<br>Abraham nonaginta novem erat annorum, quando circumcisus est in carne praeputii sui;
<br>et Ismael filius eius tredecim annos impleverat tempore circumcisionis suae.
<br>Eadem die circumcisus est Abraham et Ismael filius eius;
<br>et omnes viri domus illius, tam vernaculi quam empticii ex alienigenis, circumcisi sunt cum eo.

<br>Apparuit autem ei Dominus iuxta Quercus Mambre sedenti in ostio tabernaculi sui in ipso fervore diei.
<br>Cumque elevasset oculos, apparuerunt ei tres viri stantes prope eum. Quos cum vidisset, cucurrit in occursum eorum de ostio tabernaculi et adoravit in terram
<br>et dixit: “Domine mi, si inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, ne transeas servum tuum;
<br>afferatur pauxillum aquae, et lavate pedes vestros et requiescite sub arbore.
<br>Ponamque buccellam panis, et confortate cor vestrum, postea transibitis; idcirco enim declinastis ad servum vestrum”. Qui dixerunt: “Fac ut locutus es”.
<br>Festinavit Abraham in tabernaculum ad Saram dixitque: “Accelera, tria sata similae commisce et fac subcinericios panes”.
<br>Ipse vero ad armentum cucurrit et tulit inde vitulum tenerrimum et optimum deditque puero; qui festinavit et coxit illum.
<br>Tulit quoque butyrum et lac et vitulum, quem coxerat, et posuit coram eis. Ipse vero stabat iuxta eos sub arbore; et comederunt.
<br>Dixeruntque ad eum: “Ubi est Sara uxor tua?”. Ille respondit: “Ecce in tabernaculo est”.
<br>Cui dixit: “Revertens veniam ad te tempore isto, et habebit filium Sara uxor tua”. Quo audito, Sara risit ad ostium tabernaculi, quod erat post eum.
<br>Erant autem ambo senes provectaeque aetatis, et desierant Sarae fieri muliebria.
<br>Quae risit occulte dicens: “Postquam consenui, et dominus meus vetulus est, voluptas mihi erit?”.
<br>Dixit autem Dominus ad Abraham: “Quare risit Sara dicens: "Num vere paritura sum anus?"”.
<br>Numquid Domino est quidquam difficile? Revertar ad te hoc eodem tempore, et habebit Sara filium ”.
<br>Negavit Sara dicens: “Non risi”, timore perterrita. Ille autem dixit: “Non; sed risisti”.
<br>Cum ergo surrexissent inde viri, direxerunt oculos contra Sodomam; et Abraham simul gradiebatur deducens eos. 
<br>Dixitque Dominus: “Num celare potero Abraham, quae gesturus sum,
<br>cum futurus sit in gentem magnam ac robustissimam, et benedicendae sint in illo omnes nationes terrae?
<br>Nam elegi eum, ut praecipiat filiis suis et domui suae post se, ut custodiant viam Domini et faciant iustitiam et iudicium, ut adducat Dominus super Abraham omnia, quae locutus est ad eum”.
<br>Dixit itaque Dominus: “Clamor contra Sodomam et Gomorram multiplicatus est, et peccatum eorum aggravatum est nimis.
<br>Descendam et videbo utrum clamorem, qui venit ad me, opere compleverint an non; sciam”.
<br>Converteruntque se inde viri et abierunt Sodomam; Abraham vero adhuc stabat coram Domino.
<br>Et appropinquans ait: “Numquid vere perdes iustum cum impio?
<br>Si forte fuerint quinquaginta iusti in civitate, vere perdes et non parces loco illi propter quinquaginta iustos, si fuerint in eo?
<br>Absit a te, ut rem hanc facias et occidas iustum cum impio, fiatque iustus sicut impius; absit a te. Nonne iudex universae terrae faciet iudicium?”.
<br>Dixitque Dominus: “Si invenero Sodomae quinquaginta iustos in medio civitatis, dimittam omni loco propter eos”.
<br>Respondensque Abraham ait: “Ecce coepi loqui ad Dominum meum, cum sim pulvis et cinis.
<br>Quid, si forte minus quinquaginta iustis quinque fuerint? Delebis propter quinque universam urbem?”. Et ait: “Non delebo, si invenero ibi quadraginta quinque”.
<br>Rursumque locutus est ad eum: “Si forte inventi fuerint ibi quadraginta?”. Ait: “Non percutiam propter quadraginta”. 
<br>“Ne, quaeso, inquit, indignetur Dominus meus, si loquar. Si forte ibi inventi fuerint triginta?”. Respondit: “Non faciam, si invenero ibi triginta”. 
<br>“Ecce, ait, coepi loqui ad Dominum meum. Si forte inventi fuerint ibi viginti? ”. Dixit: “Non interficiam propter viginti”. 
<br>“Obsecro, inquit, ne irascatur Dominus meus, si loquar adhuc semel. Si forte inventi fuerint ibi decem?”. Dixit: “Non delebo propter decem”.
<br>Abiit Dominus, postquam cessavit loqui ad Abraham; et ille reversus est in locum suum.

<br>Veneruntque duo angeli Sodomam vespere, sedente Lot in foribus civitatis. Qui cum vidisset eos, surrexit et ivit obviam eis adoravitque pronus in terram 
<br>et dixit: “Obsecro, domini mei, declinate in domum pueri vestri et pernoctate; lavate pedes vestros et mane proficiscemini in viam vestram”. Qui dixerunt: “Minime, sed in platea pernoctabimus”. 
<br>Compulit illos oppido, et diverterunt ad eum. Ingressisque domum illius fecit convivium et coxit azyma, et comederunt.
<br>Prius autem quam irent cubitum, viri civitatis, viri Sodomae, vallaverunt domum a iuvene usque ad senem, omnis populus simul.
<br>Vocaveruntque Lot et dixerunt ei: “Ubi sunt viri, qui introierunt ad te nocte? Educ illos ad nos, ut cognoscamus eos”.
<br>Egressus ad eos Lot post tergum occludens ostium ait:
<br>“Nolite, quaeso, fratres mei, nolite malum hoc facere.
<br>Ecce, habeo duas filias, quae necdum cognoverunt virum; educam eas ad vos, et facite eis sicut placuerit vobis, dummodo viris istis nihil faciatis; ideo enim ingressi sunt sub umbra tecti mei”.
<br>At illi dixerunt: “Recede illuc”. Et rursus: “Unus ingressus est, inquiunt, ut advena et vult iudicare? Te ergo ipsum magis quam hos affligemus”. Vimque faciebant Lot vehementissime, iamque prope erat, ut effringerent fores.
<br>Et ecce miserunt manum viri et introduxerunt ad se Lot clauseruntque ostium;
<br>et eos, qui foris erant, percusserunt caecitate a minimo usque ad maximum, ita ut ostium invenire non possent.
<br>Dixerunt autem viri ad Lot: “Habes hic quempiam tuorum? Generum et filios et filias et omnes, qui tui sunt in urbe, educ de loco hoc:
<br>delebimus enim locum istum, eo quod increverit clamor contra eos coram Domino, qui misit nos, ut perdamus eam”.
<br>Egressus itaque Lot locutus est ad generos suos, qui accepturi erant filias eius, et dixit: “Surgite, egredimini de loco isto, quia delebit Dominus civitatem”. Et visus est eis quasi ludens loqui.
<br>Cumque esset mane, cogebant eum angeli dicentes: “Surge, tolle uxorem tuam et duas filias, quas habes hic, ne pereas in scelere civitatis”.
<br>Tardante illo, apprehenderunt viri manum eius et manum uxoris ac duarum filiarum eius, eo quod parceret Dominus illi.
<br>Et eduxerunt eum posueruntque extra civitatem. Ibi locutus est: “Salvare, agitur de vita tua; noli respicere post tergum, nec stes in omni circa regione; sed in monte salvum te fac, ne pereas”.
<br>Dixitque Lot ad eos: “Non, quaeso, Domine.
<br>Ecce invenit servus tuus gratiam coram te, et magnificasti misericordiam tuam, quam fecisti mecum, ut salvares animam meam; nec possum in monte salvari, ne forte apprehendat me malum et moriar.
<br>Ecce, civitas haec iuxta, ad quam possum fugere, parva, et salvabor in ea ­ numquid non modica est? ­ et vivet anima mea”.
<br>Dixitque ad eum: “Ecce, etiam in hoc suscepi preces tuas, ut non subvertam urbem, pro qua locutus es.
<br>Festina et salvare ibi, quia non potero facere quidquam, donec ingrediaris illuc”. Idcirco vocatum est nomen urbis illius Segor.
<br>Sol egressus est super terram, et Lot ingressus est Segor.
<br>Igitur Dominus pluit super Sodomam et Gomorram sulphur et ignem a Domino de caelo
<br>et subvertit civitates has et omnem circa regionem, universos habitatores urbium et cuncta terrae virentia.
<br>Respiciensque uxor eius post se versa est in statuam salis.
<br>Abraham autem consurgens mane venit ad locum, ubi steterat prius cum Domino,
<br>intuitus est Sodomam et Gomorram et universam terram regionis illius; viditque ascendentem favillam de terra quasi fornacis fumum.
<br>Cum enim subverteret Deus civitates regionis illius, recordatus Abrahae liberavit Lot de subversione urbium, in quibus habitaverat.
<br>Ascenditque Lot de Segor et mansit in monte, duae quoque filiae eius cum eo; timuerat enim manere in Segor. Et mansit in spelunca ipse et duae filiae eius.
<br>Dixitque maior ad minorem: “Pater noster senex est, et nullus virorum remansit in terra, qui possit ingredi ad nos iuxta morem universae terrae.
<br>Veni, inebriemus patrem nostrum vino dormiamusque cum eo, ut servare possimus ex patre nostro semen”.
<br>Dederunt itaque patri suo bibere vinum nocte illa, et ingressa est maior dormivitque cum patre; at ille non sensit, nec quando accubuit filia nec quando surrexit.
<br>Altera quoque die dixit maior ad minorem: “Ecce, dormivi heri cum patre meo; demus ei bibere vinum etiam hac nocte, et ingressa dormies cum eo, ut salvemus semen de patre nostro”.
<br>Dederunt et illa nocte patri suo bibere vinum, ingressaque minor filia dormivit cum eo; et ne tunc quidem sensit, quando illa concubuerit vel quando surrexerit.
<br>Conceperunt ergo duae filiae Lot de patre suo.
<br>Peperitque maior filium et vocavit nomen eius Moab; ipse est pater Moabitarum usque in praesentem diem.
<br>Minor quoque peperit filium et vocavit nomen eius Benammi (id est Filius populi mei); ipse est pater Ammonitarum usque hodie.

<br>Profectus inde Abraham in terram Nageb, habitavit inter Cades et Sur et peregrinatus est in Geraris.
<br>Dixitque de Sara uxore sua: “Soror mea est”. Misit ergo Abimelech rex Gerarae et tulit eam.
<br>Venit autem Deus ad Abimelech per somnium nocte et ait illi: “En morieris propter mulierem, quam tulisti; habet enim virum”.
<br>Abimelech vero non tetigerat eam. Et ait: “Domine, num gentem etiam iustam interficies?
<br>Nonne ipse dixit mihi: "Soror mea est", et ipsa quoque ait: "Frater meus est"? In simplicitate cordis mei et munditia manuum mearum feci hoc”.
<br>Dixitque ad eum Deus per somnium: “Et ego scio quod simplici corde feceris; et ideo custodivi te, ne peccares in me, et non dimisi, ut tangeres eam.
<br>Nunc igitur redde viro suo uxorem, quia propheta est; et orabit pro te, et vives. Si autem nolueris reddere, scito quod morte morieris tu et omnia, quae tua sunt”.
<br>Statimque de nocte consurgens Abimelech vocavit omnes servos suos et locutus est universa verba haec in auribus eorum; timueruntque viri valde.
<br>Vocavit autem Abimelech etiam Abraham et dixit ei: “Quid fecisti nobis? Quid peccavi in te, quia induxisti super me et super regnum meum peccatum grande? Quae non debuisti facere, fecisti mihi”.
<br>Rursusque ait: “Quid vidisti, ut hoc faceres?”.
<br>Respondit Abraham: “ Cogitavi mecum: Certe non est timor Dei in loco isto, et interficient me propter uxorem meam.
<br>Alias autem et vere soror mea est, filia patris mei et non filia matris meae, et duxi eam in uxorem.
<br>Cum autem vagari me faceret Deus de domo patris mei, dixi ad eam: Hanc misericordiam facies mecum: in omni loco, ad quem ingrediemur, dices quod frater tuus sim ”.
<br>Tulit igitur Abimelech oves et boves et servos et ancillas et dedit Abraham; reddiditque illi Saram uxorem suam
<br>et ait: “Ecce terra mea coram te; ubicumque tibi placuerit, habita”.
<br>Sarae autem dixit: “Ecce mille argenteos dedi fratri tuo; ecce hoc erit tibi in velamen oculorum ad omnes, qui tecum sunt, et apud omnes iustificaberis”.
<br>Orante autem Abraham, sanavit Deus Abimelech et uxorem ancillasque eius et pepererunt;
<br>concluserat enim Dominus omnem vulvam domus Abimelech propter Saram uxorem Abraham.

<br>Visitavit autem Dominus Saram, sicut promiserat, et implevit Sarae, quae locutus est;
<br>concepitque et peperit Abrahae filium in senectute eius tempore, quo praedixerat ei Deus.
<br>Vocavitque Abraham nomen filii sui, quem genuit ei Sara, Isaac
<br>et circumcidit eum octavo die, sicut praeceperat ei Deus.
<br>Cum Abraham centum esset annorum, natus est ei Isaac filius eius.
<br>Dixitque Sara:<br>
“Risum fecit mihi Deus;<br>
quicumque audierit, corridebit mihi ?.
<br>Rursumque ait:<br>
? Quis auditurum crederet Abraham<br>
quod Sara lactaret filios,<br>
quia peperit ei filium<br>
iam seni?”.
<br>Crevit igitur puer et ablactatus est. Fecitque Abraham grande convivium in die ablactationis eius.
<br>Cumque vidisset Sara filium Agar Aegyptiae iocantem cum Isaac filio suo, dixit ad Abraham:
<br>“Eice ancillam hanc et filium eius; non enim erit heres filius ancillae cum filio meo Isaac”.
<br>Dure accepit hoc Abraham propter filium suum.
<br>Cui dixit Deus: “Non tibi videatur asperum super puero et super ancilla tua; omnia, quae dixerit tibi Sara, audi vocem eius, quia in Isaac vocabitur tibi semen.
<br>Sed et filium ancillae faciam in gentem magnam, quia semen tuum est”.
<br>Surrexit itaque Abraham mane et tollens panem et utrem aquae imposuit scapulae eius tradiditque puerum et dimisit eam. Quae cum abisset, errabat in deserto Bersabee.
<br>Cumque consumpta esset aqua in utre, abiecit puerum subter unum arbustum
<br>et abiit; seditque e regione procul, quantum potest arcus iacere. Dixit enim: “Non videbo morientem puerum”. Et sedens contra levavit vocem suam et flevit.
<br>Exaudivit autem Deus vocem pueri; vocavitque angelus Dei Agar de caelo dicens: “Quid tibi, Agar? Noli timere; exaudivit enim Deus vocem pueri de loco, in quo est.
<br>Surge, tolle puerum et tene illum manu tua, quia in gentem magnam faciam eum”.
<br>Aperuitque Deus oculos eius; quae videns puteum aquae abiit et implevit utrem deditque puero bibere.
<br>Et fuit Deus cum eo; qui crevit et moratus est in solitudine factusque est iuvenis sagittarius.
<br>Habitavitque in deserto Pharan; et accepit illi mater sua uxorem de terra Aegypti.
<br>Eodem tempore dixit Abimelech et Phicol princeps exercitus eius ad Abraham: “Deus tecum est in universis, quae agis.
<br>Iura ergo per Deum, ne noceas mihi et posteris meis stirpique meae; sed iuxta fidem, quam feci tibi, facies mihi et terrae, in qua versatus es advena”.
<br>Dixitque Abraham: “Ego iurabo”.
<br>Et increpavit Abraham Abimelech propter puteum aquae, quem vi abstulerant servi eius.
<br>Responditque Abimelech: “Nescivi quis fecerit hanc rem; sed et tu non indicasti mihi, et ego non audivi praeter hodie”.
<br>Tulit itaque Abraham oves et boves et dedit Abimelech; percusseruntque ambo foedus.
<br>Et statuit Abraham septem agnas gregis seorsum.
<br>Cui dixit Abimelech: “Quid sibi volunt septem agnae istae, quas stare fecisti seorsum?”.
<br>At ille: “Septem, inquit, agnas accipies de manu mea, ut sint in testimonium mihi, quoniam ego fodi puteum istum”.
<br>Idcirco vocatus est locus ille Bersabee, quia ibi uterque iuraverunt.
<br>Et inierunt foedus in Bersabee.
<br>Surrexit autem Abimelech et Phicol princeps militiae eius reversique sunt in terram Philisthim. Abraham vero plantavit nemus in Bersabee et invocavit ibi nomen Domini, Dei aeterni. 34 Et fuit colonus in terra Philisthim diebus multis.

<br>Quae postquam gesta sunt, tentavit Deus Abraham et dixit ad eum: “Abraham”. Ille respondit: “Adsum”.
<br>Ait: “Tolle filium tuum unigenitum, quem diligis, Isaac et vade in terram Moria; atque offer eum ibi in holocaustum super unum montium, quem monstravero tibi”.
<br>Igitur Abraham de nocte consurgens stravit asinum suum ducens secum duos iuvenes suos et Isaac filium suum. Cumque concidisset ligna in holocaustum, surrexit et abiit ad locum, quem praeceperat ei Deus.
<br>Die autem tertio, elevatis oculis, vidit locum procul
<br>dixitque ad pueros suos: “Exspectate hic cum asino. Ego et puer illuc usque properantes, postquam adoraverimus, revertemur ad vos”.
<br>Tulit quoque ligna holocausti et imposuit super Isaac filium suum; ipse vero portabat in manibus ignem et cultrum. Cumque duo pergerent simul,
<br>dixit Isaac Abrahae patri suo: “Pater mi”. Ille respondit: “Quid vis, fili?”. “Ecce, inquit, ignis et ligna; ubi est victima holocausti?”.
<br>Dixit Abraham: “Deus providebit sibi victimam holocausti, fili mi”.<br>
Pergebant ambo pariter;
<br>et venerunt ad locum, quem ostenderat ei Deus, in quo aedificavit Abraham altare et desuper ligna composuit. Cumque colligasset Isaac filium suum, posuit eum in altari super struem lignorum
<br>extenditque Abraham manum et arripuit cultrum, ut immolaret filium suum.
<br>Et ecce angelus Domini de caelo clamavit: “Abraham, Abraham”. Qui respondit: “Adsum”.
<br>Dixitque: “Non extendas manum tuam super puerum neque facias illi quidquam. Nunc cognovi quod times Deum et non pepercisti filio tuo unigenito propter me”.
<br>Levavit Abraham oculos suos viditque arietem unum inter vepres haerentem cornibus; quem assumens obtulit holocaustum pro filio.
<br>Appellavitque nomen loci illius: “Dominus videt”. Unde usque hodie dicitur: “In monte Dominus videtur”.
<br>Vocavit autem angelus Domini Abraham secundo de caelo et dixit:
<br>“Per memetipsum iuravi, dicit Dominus: quia fecisti hanc rem et non pepercisti filio tuo unigenito,
<br>benedicam tibi et multiplicabo semen tuum sicut stellas caeli et velut arenam, quae est in litore maris. Possidebit semen tuum portas inimicorum suorum,
<br>et benedicentur in semine tuo omnes gentes terrae, quia oboedisti voci meae”.
<br>Reversus est Abraham ad pueros suos, et surrexerunt abieruntque Bersabee simul, et habitavit Abraham in Bersabee.
<br>His ita gestis, nuntiatum est Abrahae quod Melcha quoque genuisset filios Nachor fratri suo:
<br>Us primogenitum et Buz fratrem eius et Camuel patrem Aram
<br>et Cased et Azau, Pheldas quoque et Iedlaph
<br>ac Bathuel, de quo nata est Rebecca. Octo istos genuit Melcha Nachor fratri Abrahae. 
<br>Concubina vero illius, nomine Reuma, peperit Tabee et Gaham et Tahas et Maacha.

<br>Cumque surrexisset ab officio funeris, locutus est ad filios Heth dicens:
<br>“Advena sum et inquilinus apud vos; date mihi possessionem sepulcri vobiscum, ut sepeliam mortuum meum”.
<br>Responderunt filii Heth dicentes:
<br>“Audi nos, domine, princeps Dei es apud nos: in nobilissimo sepulcrorum nostrorum sepeli mortuum tuum; nullusque te prohibebit, quin in sepulcro eius sepelias mortuum tuum”.
<br>Surrexit Abraham et adoravit populum terrae, filios videlicet Heth,
<br>dixitque ad eos: “Si placet animae vestrae, ut sepeliam mortuum meum, audite me et intercedite pro me apud Ephron filium Seor,
<br>ut det mihi speluncam Machpela, quam habet in extrema parte agri sui. Pecunia digna tradat eam mihi coram vobis in possessionem sepulcri”.
<br>Sedebat autem Ephron in medio filiorum Heth. Responditque Ephron Hetthaeus ad Abraham, filiis Heth audientibus cunctis, qui ingrediebantur portam civitatis illius, dicens:
<br>“Nequaquam ita fiat, domine mi, ausculta me. Agrum do tibi et speluncam, quae in eo est, praesentibus filiis populi mei; sepeli mortuum tuum”.
<br>Adoravit Abraham coram populo terrae
<br>et locutus est ad Ephron, audiente populo terrae: “Quaeso, ut audias me. Dabo pecuniam pro agro; suscipe eam, et sic sepeliam mortuum meum in eo”.
<br>Respondit Ephron ad Abraham dicens ei:
<br>“Domine mi, audi me. Terra quadringentorum siclorum argenti inter me et te quid est hoc? Sepeli mortuum tuum”.
<br>Auscultavit Abraham Ephron et appendit pecuniam, quam Ephron postulaverat, audientibus filiis Heth, quadringentos siclos argenti, sicut mos erat apud negotiatores.
<br>Confirmatusque est ager Ephronis, qui erat in Machpela respiciens Mambre, tam ipse quam spelunca in eo et omnes arbores eius in cunctis terminis eius per circuitum,
<br>Abrahae in possessionem, videntibus filiis Heth cunctis, qui intrabant portam civitatis illius.
<br>Deinde sepelivit Abraham Saram uxorem suam in spelunca agri Machpela, qui respiciebat Mambre ­ haec est Hebron ­ in terra Chanaan.
<br>Et confirmatus est ager et antrum, quod erat in eo, Abrahae in possessionem sepulcri a filiis Heth.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Erat autem Abraham senex dierumque multorum; et Dominus in cunctis benedixerat ei.
<br>Dixitque Abraham ad servum seniorem domus suae, qui praeerat omnibus, quae habebat: “Pone manum tuam subter femur meum,
<br>ut adiurem te per Dominum, Deum caeli et Deum terrae, ut non accipias uxorem filio meo de filiabus Chananaeorum, inter quos habito;
<br>sed ad terram et cognationem meam proficiscaris et inde accipias uxorem filio meo Isaac”.
<br>Respondit servus: “Si noluerit mulier venire mecum in terram hanc, num reducere debeo filium tuum ad terram, a quo tu egressus es?”.
<br>Dixit Abraham: “Cave, ne quando reducas illuc filium meum.
<br>Dominus, Deus caeli, qui tulit me de domo patris mei et de terra nativitatis meae, qui locutus est mihi et iuravit mihi dicens: "Semini tuo dabo terram hanc", ipse mittet angelum suum coram te, et accipies inde uxorem filio meo.
<br>Sin autem noluerit mulier sequi te, non teneberis iuramento; filium tantum meum ne reducas illuc”.
<br>Posuit ergo servus manum sub femore Abraham domini sui et iuravit illi super hac re.
<br>Tulitque servus decem camelos de grege domini sui et abiit ex omnibus bonis eius portans secum; profectusque perrexit in Aram Naharaim ad urbem Nachor.
<br>Cumque camelos fecisset accumbere extra oppidum iuxta puteum aquae vespere, tempore quo solent mulieres egredi ad hauriendam aquam, dixit:
<br>“Domine,Deus domini mei Abraham, occurre obsecro mihi hodie et fac misericordiam cum domino meo Abraham.
<br>Ecce ego sto prope fontem aquae, et filiae habitatorum huius civitatis egredientur ad hauriendam aquam.
<br>Igitur puella, cui ego dixero: "Inclina hydriam tuam, ut bibam", et illa responderit: "Bibe, quin et camelis tuis dabo potum", ipsa est, quam praeparasti servo tuo Isaac, et per hoc intellegam quod feceris misericordiam cum domino meo”.
<br>Necdum intra se verba compleverat, et ecce Rebecca egrediebatur filia Bathuel filii Melchae uxoris Nachor fratris Abraham habens hydriam in scapula:
<br>puella decora nimis, virgo et incognita viro. Descendit ad fontem et implevit hydriam ac revertebatur.
<br>Occurritque ei servus et ait: “Pauxillum mihi ad sorbendum praebe aquae de hydria tua”.
<br>Quae respondit: “Bibe, domine mi”. Celeriterque deposuit hydriam super ulnam suam et dedit ei potum.
<br>Cumque ille bibisset, adiecit: “Quin et camelis tuis hauriam aquam, donec cuncti bibant”.
<br>Effundensque hydriam in canalibus recurrit ad puteum, ut hauriret aquam; et haustam omnibus camelis dedit.
<br>Ille autem contemplabatur eam tacitus, scire volens utrum prosperum fecisset iter suum Dominus an non.
<br>Postquam ergo biberunt cameli, protulit vir anulum aureum pondo dimidii sicli pro naribus et duas armillas pro manibus eius pondo siclorum decem;
<br>dixitque: “Cuius es filia? lndica mihi. Est in domo patris tui locus nobis ad pernoctandum?”.
<br>Quae respondit: “Filia Bathuelis sum filii Melchae, quem peperit Nachor”.
<br>Et addidit dicens: “Palearum quoque et pabuli plurimum est apud nos et locus ad pernoctandum”.
<br>Inclinavit se homo et adoravit Dominum
<br>dicens: “Benedictus Dominus, Deus domini mei Abraham, qui non abstulit misericordiam et veritatem suam a domino meo et recto itinere me perduxit in domum fratris domini mei”.
<br>Cucurrit itaque puella et nuntiavit in domum matris suae omnia, quae evenerant.
<br>Habebat autem Rebecca fratrem nomine Laban, qui festinus egressus est ad hominem, ubi erat fons.
<br>Cumque vidisset anulum in naribus et armillas in manibus sororis suae et audisset cuncta verba referentis: “Haec locutus est mihi homo”, venit ad virum, qui stabat iuxta camelos et prope fontem aquae;
<br>dixitque ad eum: “Ingredere, benedicte Domini, cur foris stas? Praeparavi domum et locum camelis”.
<br>Et introduxit eum in hospitium ac destravit camelos; deditque paleas et pabulum camelis et aquam ad lavandos pedes eius et virorum, qui venerant cum eo.
<br>Et apposuit in conspectu eius panem. Qui ait: “Non comedam, donec loquar sermones meos”. Respondit: “Loquere”.
<br>At ille: “Servus, inquit, Abraham sum;
<br>et Dominus benedixit domino meo valde, magnificatusque est; et dedit ei oves et boves, argentum et aurum, servos et ancillas, camelos et asinos.
<br>Et peperit Sara uxor domini mei filium domino meo in senectute sua; deditque illi omnia, quae habuerat.
<br>Et adiuravit me dominus meus dicens: "Non accipies uxorem filio meo de filiabus Chananaeorum, in quorum terra habito;
<br>sed ad domum patris mei perges et de cognatione mea accipies uxorem filio meo".
<br>Ego vero respondi domino meo: Quid, si noluerit venire mecum mulier?
<br>"Dominus, ait, in cuius conspectu ambulo, mittet angelum suum tecum et diriget viam tuam; accipiesque uxorem filio meo de cognatione mea et de domo patris mei.
<br>Innocens eris a maledictione mea, cum veneris ad propinquos meos, et non dederint tibi; tunc innocens eris a maledictione mea".
<br>Veni ergo hodie ad fontem et dixi: Domine, Deus domini mei Abraham, si direxisti viam meam, in qua nunc ambulo,
<br>ecce sto iuxta fontem aquae; et virgo, quae egredietur ad hauriendam aquam, audierit a me: "Da mihi pauxillum aquae ad bibendum ex hydria tua";
<br>et dixerit mihi: "Et tu bibe, et camelis tuis hauriam", ipsa est mulier, quam praeparavit Dominus filio domini mei.
<br>Dum haec tacitus mecum volverem, apparuit Rebecca veniens cum hydria, quam portabat in scapula; descenditque ad fontem et hausit aquam. Et aio ad eam: Da mihi paululum bibere.
<br>Quae festina deposuit hydriam de umero et dixit mihi: "Et tu bibe, et camelis tuis potum tribuam". Bibi, et adaquavit camelos.
<br>Interrogavique eam et dixi: Cuius es filia? Quae respondit: "Filia Bathuelis sum filii Nachor, quem peperit illi Melcha".<br>
Suspendi itaque anulum in naribus eius et armillas posui in manibus eius.
<br>Pronusque adoravi Dominum benedicens Domino, Deo domini mei Abraham, qui perduxit me recto itinere, ut sumerem filiam fratris domini mei filio eius.
<br>Quam ob rem, si facitis misericordiam et veritatem cum domino meo, indicate mihi; sin autem aliud placet, et hoc dicite mihi, ut vadam ad dexteram sive ad sinistram”.
<br>Responderunt Laban et Bathuel: “A Domino egressus est sermo; non possumus extra placitum eius quidquam aliud loqui tecum.
<br>En Rebecca coram te est; tolle eam et proficiscere, et sit uxor filii domini tui, sicut locutus est Dominus”.
<br>Quod cum audisset puer Abraham, procidens adoravit in terram Dominum.
<br>Prolatisque vasis argenteis et aureis ac vestibus, dedit ea Rebeccae; res pretiosas dedit fratri eius et matri.
<br>Tunc comederunt et biberunt ipse et viri, qui erant cum eo, et pernoctaverunt ibi.<br>
Surgens autem mane locutus est puer: “Dimittite me, ut vadam ad dominum meum”.
<br>Responderuntque frater eius et mater: “Maneat puella saltem decem dies apud nos et postea proficiscetur”.
<br>“Nolite, ait, me retinere, quia Dominus direxit viam meam; dimittite me, ut pergam ad dominum meum”.
<br>Dixerunt: “Vocemus puellam et quaeramus ipsius voluntatem”.
<br>Cumque vocata venisset, sciscitati sunt: “Vis ire cum homine isto?”. Quae ait: “Vadam”.
<br>Dimiserunt ergo Rebeccam sororem eorum et nutricem illius servumque Abraham et comites eius,
<br>imprecantes prospera sorori suae atque dicentes:<br>
“Soror nostra es,<br>
crescas in mille milia,<br>
et possideat semen tuum<br>
portas inimicorum suorum!”.
<br>Igitur surrexit Rebecca et puellae illius et, ascensis camelis, secutae sunt virum; sumpsitque servus Rebeccam et abiit.
<br>Isaac autem venerat a regione putei Lahairoi et habitabat in terra Nageb.
<br>Et egressus est Isaac ad lamentandum in agro, inclinata iam die. Cumque levasset oculos, vidit camelos venientes.
<br>Rebecca quoque levavit oculos et vidit Isaac; descenditque de camelo
<br>et ait ad puerum: “Quis est ille homo, qui venit per agrum in occursum nobis?”. Dixitque ei: “Ipse est dominus meus”. At illa tollens cito velum operuit se.
<br>Servus autem cuncta, quae gesserat, narravit Isaac;
<br>qui introduxit eam in tabernaculum Sarae matris suae et accepit Rebeccam uxorem; et dilexit eam et consolatus est a morte matris suae.

<br>Abraham vero aliam duxit uxorem nomine Ceturam,
<br>quae peperit ei Zamran et Iecsan et Madan et Madian et Iesboc et Sue.
<br>Iecsan quoque genuit Saba et Dedan. Filii Dedan fuerunt Assurim et Latusim et Loommim.
<br>At vero ex Madian ortus est Epha et Opher et Henoch et Abida et Eldaa. Omnes hi filii Ceturae.
<br>Deditque Abraham cuncta, quae possederat, Isaac;
<br>filiis autem concubinarum suarum largitus est munera et separavit eos ab Isaac filio suo, dum adhuc ipse viveret, ad plagam orientalem.
<br>Fuerunt autem dies vitae Abrahae centum septuaginta quinque anni.
<br>Et deficiens mortuus est Abraham in senectute bona provectaeque aetatis et plenus dierum congregatusque est ad populum suum.
<br>Et sepelierunt eum Isaac et Ismael filii sui in spelunca Machpela, quae sita est in agro Ephron filii Seor Hetthaei e regione Mambre,
<br>quem emerat a filiis Heth. Ibi sepultus est ipse et Sara uxor eius.
<br>Et post obitum illius benedixit Deus Isaac filio eius, qui habitabat iuxta puteum Lahairoi.
<br>Hae sunt generationes Ismael filii Abrahae, quem peperit ei Agar Aegyptia famula Sarae.
<br>Et haec nomina filiorum Ismael in vocabulis et generationibus suis: primogenitus Ismaelis Nabaioth, dein Cedar et Adbeel et Mabsam,
<br>Masma quoque et Duma et Massa,
<br>Hadad et Thema, Iethur et Naphis et Cedma.
<br>Isti sunt filii Ismaelis, et haec nomina eorum per vicos et mansiones eorum: duodecim principes tribuum suarum.
<br>Et facti sunt anni vitae Ismaelis centum triginta septem; deficiens mortuus est et appositus ad populum suum.
<br>Habitaverunt autem ab Hevila usque Sur, quae respicit Aegyptum introeuntibus Assyriam. In faciem cunctorum fratrum suorum obiit.
<br>Hae sunt generationes Isaac filii Abraham: Abraham genuit Isaac;
<br>qui, cum quadraginta esset annorum, duxit uxorem Rebeccam filiam Bathuelis Aramaei de Paddanaram, sororem Laban Aramaei.
<br>Deprecatusque est Isaac Dominum pro uxore sua, eo quod esset sterilis. Qui exaudivit eum et dedit conceptum Rebeccae.
<br>Sed collidebantur in utero eius parvuli. Quae ait: “Si sic est, cur mihi?”. Perrexitque, ut consuleret Dominum.
<br>Qui respondens ait:<br>
“Duae gentes sunt in utero tuo,<br>
et duo populi ex ventre tuo dividentur;<br>
populusque populum superabit,<br>
et maior serviet minori”.
<br>Iam tempus pariendi venerat, et ecce gemini in utero eius.
<br>Qui primus egressus est rufus erat et totus quasi pallium pilosum; vocatumque est nomen eius Esau. Postea frater eius egrediens plantam Esau tenebat manu, et idcirco appellatum est nomen eius Iacob.
<br>Sexagenarius erat Isaac, quando nati sunt parvuli.
<br>Quibus adultis, factus est Esau vir gnarus venandi et homo agrestis; Iacob autem vir compositus et habitans in tabernaculis.
<br>Isaac amabat Esau, eo quod de venationibus illius libenter vesceretur; et Rebecca diligebat Iacob.
<br>Coxit autem Iacob pulmentum; ad quem, cum venisset Esau de agro lassus,
<br>ait: “Da mihi de coctione hac rufa, quia oppido lassus sum”. Quam ob causam vocatum est nomen eius Edom (id est Rufus).
<br>Cui dixit Iacob: “Vende mihi prius primogenita tua”.
<br>Ille respondit: “En morior; quid mihi proderunt primogenita?”.
<br>Ait Iacob: “Iura ergo mihi”. Iuravit et vendidit primogenita.
<br>Et sic, accepto pane et lentis edulio, comedit et bibit; surrexit et abiit parvipendens quod primogenita vendidisset.

<br>Orta autem fame super terram post eam sterilitatem, quae acciderat in diebus Abraham, abiit Isaac ad Abimelech regem Philisthim in Gerara.
<br>Apparuitque ei Dominus et ait: “Ne descendas in Aegyptum, sed habita in terra, quam dixero tibi,
<br>et peregrinare in ea; eroque tecum et benedicam tibi. Tibi enim et semini tuo dabo universas regiones has complens iuramentum, quod spopondi Abraham patri tuo,
<br>et multiplicabo semen tuum sicut stellas caeli daboque posteris tuis universas regiones has; et benedicentur in semine tuo omnes gentes terrae,
<br>eo quod oboedierit Abraham voci meae et custodierit praecepta et mandata mea et iustificationes legesque servaverit”.
<br>Mansit itaque Isaac in Geraris.
<br>Qui, cum interrogaretur a viris loci illius super uxore sua, respondit: “Soror mea est”. Timuerat enim confiteri quod sibi esset sociata coniugio, reputans ne forte interficerent eum propter illius pulchritudinem.
<br>Cumque pertransissent dies plurimi et ibidem moraretur, prospiciens Abimelech rex Philisthim per fenestram vidit eum iocantem cum Rebecca uxore sua.
<br>Et, accersito eo, ait: “Perspicuum est quod uxor tua sit; cur mentitus es eam sororem tuam esse?”. Respondit: “Timui, ne morerer propter eam”.
<br>Dixitque Abimelech: “Quare hoc fecisti nobis? Potuit coire quispiam de populo cum uxore tua, et induxeras super nos grande peccatum”. Praecepitque omni populo dicens:
<br>“Qui tetigerit hominem hunc et uxorem eius, morte morietur”.
<br>Sevit autem Isaac in terra illa et invenit in ipso anno centuplum; benedixitque ei Dominus.
<br>Et locupletatus est homo et ibat proficiens atque succrescens, donec magnus vehementer effectus est;
<br>habuitque possessionem ovium et armentorum et familiae plurimum.<br>
Ob haec invidentes ei Philisthim
<br>omnes puteos, quos foderant servi patris illius in diebus Abraham, obstruxerunt implentes humo,
<br>in tantum ut ipse Abimelech diceret ad Isaac: “ Recede a nobis, quoniam potentior nostri factus es valde ”.
<br>Et ille discedens tentoria fixit ad torrentem Gerarae habitavitque ibi.
<br>Rursum fodit puteos, quos foderant in diebus patris sui Abraham et quos, illo mortuo, obstruxerant Philisthim. Appellavitque eos eisdem nominibus, quibus ante pater vocaverat.
<br>Foderunt servi Isaac in torrente et reppererunt ibi puteum aquae vivae.
<br>Sed et ibi iurgium fuit pastorum Gerarae adversus pastores Isaac dicentium: “ Nostra est aqua! ”. Quam ob rem nomen putei vocavit Esec (id est Iurgium), quia iurgati sunt cum eo.
<br>Foderunt autem et alium puteum, et pro illo quoque rixati sunt; appellavitque eum Sitna (id est Inimicitias).
<br>Profectus inde fodit alium puteum, pro quo non contenderunt; itaque vocavit nomen eius Rehoboth (id est Latitudinem) dicens: “ Nunc dilatavit nos Dominus, et crescemus in terra ”.
<br>Ascendit autem ex illo loco in Bersabee,
<br>ubi apparuit ei Dominus in ipsa nocte dicens:<br>
“ Ego sum Deus Abraham patris tui.<br>
Noli timere, quia tecum sum;<br>
benedicam tibi<br>
et multiplicabo semen tuum<br>
propter servum meum Abraham ”.
<br>Itaque aedificavit ibi altare et, invocato nomine Domini, extendit tabernaculum, et servi Isaac foderunt ibi puteum.
<br>Abimelech autem venit ad eum de Geraris et Ochozath amicus illius et Phicol dux militum,
<br>et locutus est eis Isaac: “ Quid venistis ad me hominem, quem odistis et expulistis a vobis? ”.
<br>Qui responderunt: “ Vidimus tecum esse Dominum et idcirco diximus: Sit iuramentum inter nos et te, et ineamus tecum foedus,
<br>ut non facias nobis quidquam mali, sicut et nos non attigimus te et nihil fecimus tibi nisi bonum et cum pace dimisimus te. Tu es enim benedictus Domini ”.
<br>Fecit ergo eis convivium, et comederunt et biberunt.
<br>Surgentesque mane iuraverunt sibi mutuo. Dimisitque eos Isaac, et profecti sunt ab eo cum pace.
<br>Ecce autem venerunt in ipso die servi Isaac annuntiantes ei de puteo, quem foderant, atque dicentes: “ Invenimus aquam ”.
<br>Unde appellavit eum Sabee (quod significat Abundantiam); et nomen urbi impositum est Bersabee usque in praesentem diem.
<br>Esau vero quadragenarius duxit uxores Iudith filiam Beeri Hetthaei et Basemath filiam Elon Hetthaei.
<br>Quae ambae offenderant animum Isaac et Rebeccae.

<br>Senuit autem Isaac, et caligaverunt oculi eius, et videre non poterat. Vocavitque Esau filium suum maiorem et dixit ei: “ Fili mi ”. Qui respondit: “ Adsum ”.
<br>Cui pater: “ Vides, inquit, quod senuerim et ignorem diem mortis meae;
<br>sume arma tua, pharetram et arcum, et egredere in agrum. Cumque venatu aliquid apprehenderis,
<br>fac mihi inde pulmentum, sicut velle me nosti, et affer, ut comedam; et benedicat tibi anima mea, antequam moriar ”.
<br>Rebecca autem audierat Isaac loquentem cum Esau filio suo. Esau ergo abiit in agrum, ut venationem caperet et offerret eam.
<br>Rebecca autem dixit filio suo Iacob: “ Ecce, audivi patrem tuum loquentem cum Esau fratre tuo et dicentem ei:
<br>"Affer mihi venationem tuam et fac cibos, ut comedam et benedicam tibi coram Domino, antequam moriar".
<br>Nunc ergo, fili mi, audi vocem meam in eo, quod praecipio tibi.
<br>Pergens ad gregem affer mihi duos haedos optimos, ut faciam ex eis escas patri tuo, quibus libenter vescitur.
<br>Quas cum intuleris patri tuo, et comederit, benedicat tibi, priusquam moriatur ”.
<br>Cui ille respondit: “ Nosti quod Esau frater meus homo pilosus sit, et ego lenis.
<br>Si attrectaverit me pater meus et senserit, timeo, ne putet me sibi voluisse illudere; et inducam super me maledictionem pro benedictione”.
<br>Ad quem mater: “ In me sit, ait, ista maledictio, fili mi; tantum audi vocem meam et perge afferque, quae dixi ”.
<br>Abiit et attulit deditque matri. Paravit illa cibos, sicut noverat velle patrem illius.
<br>Et vestibus Esau valde bonis, quas apud se habebat domi, induit eum
<br>pelliculasque haedorum circumdedit manibus et colli nuda protexit;
<br>dedit pulmentum optimum et panes, quos coxerat, in manus filii sui Iacob.
<br>Qui ingressus ad patrem suum dixit: “ Pater mi ”. At ille respondit: “ Audio. Quis es tu, fili mi? ”.
<br>Dixitque Iacob ad patrem suum: “ Ego sum Esau primogenitus tuus. Feci sicut praecepisti mihi; surge, sede et comede de venatione mea, ut benedicat mihi anima tua ”.
<br>Rursum Isaac ad filium suum: “ Quomodo, inquit, tam cito invenire potuisti, fili mi? ”. Qui respondit: “ Voluntas Domini Dei tui fuit, ut occurreret mihi ”.
<br>Dixitque Isaac ad Iacob: “ Accede huc, ut tangam te, fili mi, et probem, utrum tu sis filius meus Esau an non ”.
<br>Accessit ille ad patrem, et, palpato eo, dixit Isaac: “ Vox quidem, vox Iacob est, sed manus, manus sunt Esau ”.
<br>Et non cognovit eum, quia pilosae manus similitudinem maioris expresserant. Benedixit ergo illi.
<br>Ait: “ Tu es filius meus Esau? ”. Respondit: “ Ego sum ”.
<br>At ille: “ Affer, inquit, mihi, et comedam de venatione tua, fili mi, ut benedicat tibi anima mea ”. Quos cum oblatos comedisset, obtulit ei etiam vinum. Quo hausto,
<br>dixit ad eum Isaac pater eius: “ Accede ad me et da mihi osculum, fili mi ”.
<br>Accessit et osculatus est eum. Statimque, ut sensit vestimentorum illius fragrantiam, benedicens illi ait:<br>
“ Ecce odor filii mei<br>
sicut odor agri pleni,<br>
cui benedixit Dominus.
<br>Det tibi Deus de rore caeli<br>
et de pinguedine terrae<br>
et abundantiam frumenti et vini.
<br>Et serviant tibi populi,<br>
et adorent te nationes;<br>
esto dominus fratrum tuorum,<br>
et incurventur ante te filii matris tuae.<br>
Qui maledixerit tibi, sit maledictus;<br>
et, qui benedixerit tibi, sit benedictus! ”.
<br>Vix Isaac benedictionem Iacob finierat, et Iacob egressus erat a patre suo Isaac, venit Esau frater eius
<br>coctosque de venatione cibos intulit patri dicens: “ Surge, pater mi, et comede de venatione filii tui, ut benedicat mihi anima tua ”.
<br>Dixitque illi Isaac pater eius: “ Quis enim es tu? ”. Qui respondit: “ Ego sum filius tuus primogenitus Esau ”.
<br>Expavit Isaac stupore vehementi ultra modum et ait: “ Quis igitur ille est, qui dudum captam venationem attulit mihi, et comedi ex omnibus, priusquam tu venires? Benedixique ei, et erit benedictus! ”.
<br>Auditis Esau sermonibus patris, irrugiit clamore magno et amaro ultra modum et ait patri suo: “ Benedic etiam mihi, pater mi! ”.
<br>Qui ait: “ Venit germanus tuus fraudulenter et accepit benedictionem tuam ”.
<br>At ille subiunxit: “ Iuste vocatum est nomen eius Iacob; supplantavit enim me en altera vice: primogenita mea ante tulit et nunc secundo surripuit benedictionem meam ”.<br>
Rursumque ait: “ Numquid non reservasti mihi benedictionem? ”.
<br>Respondit Isaac: “ Ecce, dominum tuum illum constitui et omnes fratres eius servituti illius subiugavi; frumento et vino stabilivi eum. Et tibi post haec, fili mi, ultra quid faciam? ”.
<br>Dixitque Esau ad patrem suum: “ Num unam tantum benedictionem habes, pater mi? Mihi quoque obsecro, ut benedicas! ”. Cumque eiulatu magno fleret,
<br>motus Isaac dixit ad eum:<br>
“ Ecce, procul a pinguedine terrae erit habitatio tua<br>
et procul a rore caeli desuper.
<br>De gladio tuo vives<br>
et fratri tuo servies.<br>
Tempusque veniet, cum excutias<br>
et solvas iugum eius de cervicibus tuis ”.
<br>Oderat ergo Esau Iacob pro benedictione, qua benedixerat ei pater, dixitque in corde suo: “ Appropinquabunt dies luctus patris mei, et occidam Iacob fratrem meum ”.
<br>Nuntiata sunt Rebeccae verba Esau filii eius maioris, quae mittens et vocans Iacob filium suum minorem dixit ad eum: “ Ecce, Esau frater tuus minatur, ut occidat te.
<br>Nunc ergo, fili mi, audi vocem meam et consurgens fuge ad Laban fratrem meum in Charran;
<br>habitabisque cum eo dies paucos, donec requiescat furor fratris tui,
<br>et cesset indignatio eius, obliviscaturque eorum, quae fecisti in eum. Postea mittam et adducam te inde huc. Cur utroque orbabor filio in uno die? ”.
<br>Dixit quoque Rebecca ad Isaac: “ Taedet me vitae meae propter filias Heth; si acceperit Iacob uxorem de filiabus Heth sicut istis de filiabus terrae, nolo vivere ”.

<br>Vocavit itaque Isaac Iacob et benedixit eum praecepit que ei dicens: “ Noli accipere coniugem de filiabus Chanaan;
<br>surge, vade in Paddanaram ad domum Bathuel patris matris tuae et accipe tibi inde uxorem de filiabus Laban avunculi tui.
<br>Deus autem omnipotens benedicat tibi et crescere te faciat atque multiplicet, ut sis in multitudinem populorum;
<br>et det tibi benedictiones Abraham tibi et semini tuo tecum, ut possideas terram peregrinationis tuae, quam pollicitus est Deus avo tuo ”.
<br>Cumque dimisisset eum Isaac, profectus est in Paddanaram ad Laban filium Bathuel Aramaei fratrem Rebeccae matris Iacob et Esau.
<br>Videns autem Esau quod benedixisset pater suus Iacob et misisset eum in Paddanaram, ut inde uxorem duceret, et quod post benedictionem praecepisset ei dicens: “ Non accipies uxorem de filiabus Chanaan ”,
<br>quodque oboediens Iacob parentibus suis isset in Paddanaram;
<br>probans quoque quod non libenter aspiceret filias Chanaan pater suus,
<br>ivit ad Ismaelem et duxit uxorem, absque iis, quas habebat, Mahalath filiam Ismael filii Abraham sororem Nabaioth.
<br>Igitur egressus Iacob de Bersabee pergebat Charran.
<br>Cumque venisset ad quendam locum et vellet in eo requiescere post solis occubitum, tulit de lapidibus, qui iacebant, et supponens capiti suo dormivit in eodem loco.
<br>Viditque in somnio scalam stantem super terram et cacumen illius tangens caelum, angelos quoque Dei ascendentes et descendentes per eam
<br>et Dominum innixum scalae dicentem sibi: “ Ego sum Dominus, Deus Abraham patris tui et Deus Isaac. Terram, in qua dormis, tibi dabo et semini tuo.
<br>Eritque semen tuum quasi pulvis terrae; dilataberis ad occidentem et orientem et septentrionem et meridiem; et benedicentur in te et in semine tuo cunctae tribus terrae.
<br>Et ecce, ego tecum sum et custodiam te, quocumque perrexeris, et reducam te in terram hanc; nec dimittam te, nisi complevero quae dixi tibi ”.
<br>Cumque evigilasset Iacob de somno, ait: “ Vere Dominus est in loco isto, et ego nesciebam ”.
<br>Pavensque: “ Quam terribilis est, inquit, locus iste! Non est hic aliud nisi domus Dei et porta caeli ”.
<br>Surgens ergo Iacob mane tulit lapidem, quem supposuerat capiti suo, et erexit in titulum fundens oleum desuper.
<br>Appellavitque nomen loci illius Bethel; prius autem urbs vocabatur Luza.
<br>Vovit Iacob etiam votum dicens: “ Si fuerit Deus mecum et custodierit me in via hac, per quam ambulo, et dederit mihi panem ad vescendum et vestimentum ad induendum,
<br>reversusque fuero prospere ad domum patris mei, erit mihi Dominus in Deum,
<br>et lapis iste, quem erexi in titulum, erit domus Dei; cunctorumque, quae dederis mihi, decimas offeram tibi ”.

<br>Profectus ergo Iacob venit in terram orientalium.
<br>Et vidit puteum in agro, tres quoque greges ovium accubantes iuxta eum; nam ex illo adaquabantur pecora, et os eius grandi lapide claudebatur.
<br>Morisque erat, ut, cunctis ovibus congregatis, devolverent lapidem et, refectis gregibus, rursum super os putei ponerent.
<br>Dixitque ad pastores: “ Fratres, unde estis? ”. Qui responderunt: “ De Charran ”.
<br>Quos interrogans: “ Numquid, ait, nostis Laban filium Nachor? ”. Dixerunt: “ Novimus ”.
<br>“ Sanusne est? ”, inquit. “ Valet, inquiunt, et ecce Rachel filia eius venit cum grege ”.
<br>Dixitque: “ Adhuc multum diei superest, nec est tempus, ut congregentur greges; date potum ovibus et sic ad pastum eas reducite ”.
<br>Qui responderunt: “ Non possumus, donec omnia pecora congregentur et amoveamus lapidem de ore putei, ut adaquemus greges ”.
<br>Adhuc loquebatur cum eis, et ecce Rachel veniebat cum ovibus patris sui; nam gregem ipsa pascebat.
<br>Cum vidisset Iacob Rachel filiam Laban avunculi sui ovesque Laban avunculi sui, accedens amovit lapidem de ore putei
<br>et adaquavit gregem Laban avunculi sui. Tunc Iacob osculatus est Rachel et elevata voce flevit;
<br>et indicavit ei quod frater esset patris eius et filius Rebeccae. At illa festinans nuntiavit patri suo.
<br>Qui cum audisset venisse Iacob filium sororis suae, cucurrit obviam ei; complexusque eum et in oscula ruens duxit in domum suam. Auditis autem omnibus, quae evenerant,
<br>respondit: “ Vere os meum es et caro mea! ”.<br>
Et, postquam Iacob habitavit apud eum per dies mensis unius,
<br>dixit ei Laban: “ Num, quia frater meus es, gratis servies mihi? Dic quid mercedis accipias ”.
<br>Habebat vero filias duas: nomen maioris Lia, minor vero appellabatur Rachel;
<br>sed Lia lippis erat oculis, Rachel decora et venusto aspectu.
<br>Quam diligens Iacob ait: “ Serviam tibi pro Rachel filia tua minore septem annis ”.
<br>Respondit Laban: “ Melius est, ut tibi eam dem quam alteri viro; mane apud me ”.
<br>Servivit igitur Iacob pro Rachel septem annis, et videbantur illi pauci dies prae amoris magnitudine.
<br>Dixitque ad Laban: “ Da mihi uxorem meam, quia iam tempus expletum est, ut ingrediar ad eam ”.
<br>Qui, vocatis omnibus viris loci ad convivium, fecit nuptias.
<br>Et vespere sumpsit Liam filiam suam et introduxit ad eum, et venit ad eam.
<br>Et dedit Laban ancillam filiae Zelpham nomine.<br>
Facto mane, vidit, et ecce erat Lia.
<br>Et dixit ad socerum suum: “ Quid hoc fecisti mihi? Nonne pro Rachel servivi tibi? Quare imposuisti mihi? ”.
<br>Respondit Laban: “ Non est in loco nostro consuetudinis, ut minorem ante maiorem tradamus ad nuptias.
<br>Imple hebdomadam hanc, et alteram quoque dabo tibi pro opere, quo serviturus es mihi septem annis aliis ”.
<br>Acquievit placito et, hebdomada transacta, dedit ei Laban filiam suam Rachel uxorem,
<br>cui servam Bilham tradidit.
<br>Et ingressus etiam ad Rachel amavit eam plus quam Liam serviens apud eum septem annis aliis.
<br>Videns autem Dominus quod despiceret Liam, aperuit vulvam eius, Rachel sterili permanente.
<br>Et concepit Lia et genuit filium vocavitque nomen eius Ruben dicens: “ Vidit Dominus humilitatem meam; nunc amabit me vir meus ”.
<br>Rursumque concepit et peperit filium et ait: “ Quoniam audivit me Dominus haberi contemptui, dedit etiam istum mihi ”; vocavitque nomen illius Simeon.
<br>Concepit tertio et genuit alium filium dixitque: “ Nunc quoque copulabitur mihi maritus meus, eo quod pepererim ei tres filios ”; et idcirco appellavit nomen eius Levi.
<br>Quarto concepit et peperit filium et ait: “ Modo confitebor Domino ”; et ob hoc vocavit eum Iudam. Cessavitque parere.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Cernens autem Rachel quod infecunda esset, invidit sorori et ait marito suo: “ Da mihi liberos, alioquin moriar ”.
<br>Cui iratus respondit Iacob: “ Num pro Deo ego sum, qui privavit te fructu ventris? ”.
<br>At illa: “ Ecce, inquit, famula mea Bilha; ingredere ad illam, ut pariat super genua mea, et habeam ex illa et ego filios ”.
<br>Deditque illi Bilham famulam suam in coniugium. Quae,
<br>ingresso ad se Iacob, concepit et peperit filium.
<br>Dixitque Rachel: “ Iudicavit mihi Deus et exaudivit vocem quoque meam dans mihi filium ”; et idcirco appellavit nomen illius Dan.
<br>Rursumque Bilha famula Rachel concepit et peperit Iacob alterum filium, et
<br>ait Rachel: “ Certamina Dei certavi cum sorore mea et invalui ”; vocavitque eum Nephthali.
<br>Sentiens Lia quod parere desisset, sumpsit Zelpham ancillam suam et tradidit eam Iacob in uxorem.
<br>Quae peperit Iacob filium.
<br>Dixitque Lia: “ Feliciter! ”; et idcirco vocavit nomen eius Gad.
<br>Peperit quoque Zelpha ancilla Liae Iacob alterum filium.
<br>Dixitque Lia: “ Pro beatitudine mea! Beatam quippe me dicent mulieres ”; propterea appellavit eum Aser.
<br>Egressus autem Ruben tempore messis triticeae, repperit in agro mandragoras, quas Liae matri suae detulit. Dixitque Rachel: “ Da mihi partem de mandragoris filii tui ”.
<br>Illa respondit: “ Parumne tibi videtur, quod praeripueris maritum mihi, ut etiam mandragoras filii mei auferas? ”. Ait Rachel: “ Dormiat ergo tecum hac nocte pro mandragoris filii tui ”.
<br>Redeuntique ad vesperam Iacob de agro egressa est in occursum eius Lia et: “ Ad me, inquit, intrabis, quia mercede conduxi te pro mandragoris filii mei ”. Dormivitque cum ea nocte illa.
<br>Et exaudivit Deus Liam, concepitque et peperit Iacob filium quintum
<br>et ait: “ Dedit Deus mercedem mihi, quia dedi ancillam meam viro meo ”; appellavitque nomen illius Issachar.
<br>Rursum Lia concepit et peperit Iacob sextum filium
<br>et ait: “ Donavit me Deus dono bono; hac vice honorabit me maritus meus, eo quod genuerim ei sex filios ”; et idcirco appellavit nomen eius Zabulon.
<br>Post quem peperit filiam nomine Dinam.
<br>Recordatus quoque Deus Rachelis exaudivit eam Deus et aperuit vulvam illius.
<br>Quae concepit et peperit filium dicens: “ Abstulit Deus opprobrium meum ”;
<br>et vocavit nomen illius Ioseph dicens: “ Addat mihi Dominus filium alterum! ”.
<br>Nato autem Ioseph, dixit Iacob ad Laban: “ Dimitte me, ut revertar in patriam et ad terram meam.
<br>Da mihi uxores et liberos meos, pro quibus servivi tibi, ut abeam; tu nosti servitutem, qua servivi tibi ”.
<br>Ait illi Laban: “ Inveniam gratiam in conspectu tuo; augurio didici, quia benedixerit mihi Deus propter te.
<br>Constitue mercedem tuam, quam dem tibi ”.
<br>At ille respondit: “ Tu nosti quomodo servierim tibi et quanti in manibus meis facti sint greges tui.
<br>Modicum habuisti, antequam venirem ad te, et nunc multiplicatum est vehementer, benedixitque tibi Dominus ad introitum meum. Nunc autem quando providebo etiam domui meae? ”.
<br>Dixitque Laban: “ Quid tibi dabo? ”. At ille ait: “ Nihil mihi dabis; si feceris, quod postulo, iterum pascam et custodiam pecora tua.
<br>Gyrabo omnes greges tuos hodie; separa cuncta pecora varia et maculosa et, quodcumque furvum in ovibus et maculosum variumque in capris fuerit, erit merces mea.
<br>Respondebitque mihi cras iustitia mea; quando veneris, ut inspicias mercedem meam, omnia, quae non fuerint varia et maculosa in capris et furva in ovibus, furti me arguent ”.
<br>Dixit Laban: “ Gratum habeo, quod petis! ”.
<br>Et separavit in die illo hircos striatos atque maculosos et omnes capras varias et maculosas, omne, in quo album erat, et omne furvum in ovibus, et tradidit in manu filiorum suorum.
<br>Et posuit spatium itineris trium dierum inter se et Iacob, qui pascebat reliquos greges Laban.
<br>Tollens ergo Iacob virgas virides populeas et amygdalinas et ex platanis, ex parte ita decorticavit eas, ut in his, quae spoliata fuerant, candor appareret.
<br>Posuitque virgas, quas ex parte decorticaverat, in canalibus, ubi effundebatur aqua, ut, cum venissent greges ad bibendum, ante oculos haberent virgas et in aspectu earum conciperent.
<br>Factumque est ut in ipso calore coitus greges intuerentur virgas et parerent striata et varia et maculosa.
<br>Agnos autem segregavit Iacob et posuit gregem ex adverso striatorum et omnium furvorum in grege Laban et constituit sibi greges seorsum neque statuit eos cum grege Laban.
<br>Quotiescumque igitur calefiebant pecora robusta, ponebat Iacob virgas in canalibus aquarum ante oculos pecorum, ut in earum contemplatione conciperent.
<br>Quando vero pecora debilia erant, non ponebat eas. Factaque sunt debilia Laban et robusta Iacob;
<br>ditatusque est homo ultra modum et habuit greges multos, ancillas et servos, camelos et asinos.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Postquam autem audivit verba filiorum Laban dicentium: “ Tulit Iacob omnia, quae fuerunt patris nostri, et de patris nostri facultate acquisivit has divitias ”,
<br>animadvertit quoque faciem Laban quod non esset erga se sicut heri et nudiustertius.
<br>Et dixit Dominus ad Iacob: “ Revertere in terram patrum tuorum et ad cognationem tuam, eroque tecum ”.
<br>Misit Iacob et vocavit Rachel et Liam in agrum, ubi pascebat greges,
<br>dixitque eis: “ Video faciem patris vestri quod non sit erga me sicut heri et nudiustertius; Deus autem patris mei fuit mecum,
<br>et ipsae nostis quod totis viribus meis servierim patri vestro.
<br>Sed pater vester circumvenit me et mutavit mercedem meam decem vicibus; et tamen non dimisit eum Deus, ut noceret mihi.
<br>Si quando dixit: "Variae erunt mercedes tuae", pariebant omnes oves varios fetus. Quando vero e contrario ait: "Striata quaeque accipies pro mercede", omnes greges striata pepererunt.
<br>Tulitque Deus substantiam patris vestri et dedit mihi.
<br>Postquam enim conceptus gregis tempus advenerat, levavi oculos meos et vidi in somnis ascendentes mares super feminas, striatos et varios et respersos.
<br>Dixitque angelus Dei ad me in somnis: "Iacob". Et ego respondi: Adsum.
<br>Qui ait: "Leva oculos tuos et vide universos masculos ascendentes super feminas, striatos et varios atque respersos. Vidi enim omnia, quae fecit tibi Laban.
<br>Ego sum Deus Bethel, ubi unxisti lapidem et votum vovisti mihi. Nunc ergo surge et egredere de terra hac revertens in terram nativitatis tuae" ”.
<br>Responderunt ei Rachel et Lia: “ Numquid habemus adhuc partem et hereditatem in domo patris nostri?
<br>Nonne quasi alienas reputavit nos et vendidit nos comeditque pretium nostrum?
<br>Sed omnes opes, quas tulit Deus patri nostro, nobis abstulit ac filiis nostris; unde omnia, quae praecepit tibi Deus, fac ”.
<br>Surrexit itaque Iacob et imposuit liberos suos ac coniuges suas super camelos.
<br>Tulitque omnes greges suos et omnem substantiam suam, quidquid in Paddanaram acquisierat, ut iret ad Isaac patrem suum in terram Chanaan.
<br>Eo tempore Laban ierat ad tondendas oves, et Rachel furata est theraphim patris sui.
<br>Iacob autem decepit cor Laban, non indicans ei quod fugeret.
<br>Cumque fugisset cum omnibus, quae possidebat, et, amne transmisso, pergeret contra montem Galaad,
<br>nuntiatum est Laban die tertio quod fugisset Iacob.
<br>Qui, assumptis fratribus suis, persecutus est eum diebus septem et comprehendit eum in monte Galaad.
<br>Venit autem Deus ad Laban Aramaeum per somnium noctis dixitque ei: "Cave, ne quidquam loquaris contra Iacob!".
<br>Iamque Iacob extenderat in monte tabernaculum, cum Laban, consecutus eum cum fratribus suis, in eodem monte Galaad fixit tentorium.
<br>Et dixit ad Iacob: “ Quare ita egisti et decepisti cor meum, abigens filias meas quasi captivas gladio?
<br>Cur clam fugisti et decepisti me, non indicans mihi, ut prosequerer te cum gaudio et canticis et tympanis et citharis?
<br>Non es passus, ut oscularer filios meos ac filias; stulte operatus es. Et nunc
<br>valet quidem manus mea reddere tibi malum, sed Deus patris vestri heri dixit mihi: “Cave, ne loquaris contra Iacob quidquam!”.
<br>Esto, profectus es, quia desiderio tibi erat domus patris tui; cur furatus es deos meos? ”.
<br>Respondit Iacob: “ Quia timui. Dixi enim, ne forte violenter auferres filias tuas a me.
<br>Apud quemcumque inveneris deos tuos, non vivat! Coram fratribus nostris scrutare, quidquid tuorum apud me inveneris, et aufer ”. Ignorabat enim Iacob quod Rachel furata esset theraphim.
<br>Ingressus itaque Laban tabernacula Iacob et Liae et utriusque famulae, non invenit. Egressus de tentorio Liae, intravit tentorium Rachelis.
<br>Illa autem absconderat theraphim in stramento cameli et sedit desuper. Scrutantique omne tentorium et nihil invenienti
<br>ait: “ Ne irascatur dominus meus, quod coram te assurgere nequeo, quia iuxta consuetudinem feminarum nunc accidit mihi ”. Quaesivit ergo et non invenit theraphim.
<br>Tumensque Iacob cum iurgio ait: “ Quam ob culpam meam et ob quod peccatum meum sic persecutus es me,
<br>quia scrutatus es omnem supellectilem meam? Quid invenisti de cuncta substantia domus tuae? Pone hic coram fratribus meis et fratribus tuis, et iudicent inter me et te.
<br>Ecce, viginti annis fui tecum. Oves tuae et caprae non abortiverunt, arietes gregis tui non comedi;
<br>nec dilaceratum a bestia ostendi tibi: ego damnum omne reddebam; quidquid die noctuque furto perierat, a me exigebas.
<br>Die aestu consumebar et nocte gelu, fugiebatque somnus ab oculis meis.
<br>Sic per viginti annos in domo tua servivi tibi: quattuordecim pro filiabus et sex pro gregibus tuis; immutasti quoque mercedem meam decem vicibus.
<br>Nisi Deus patris mei, Deus Abraham et Timor Isaac, affuisset mihi, certemodo nudum me dimisisses; afflictionem meam et laborem manuum mearum respexit Deus et iudicavit heri ”.
<br>Respondit ei Laban: “ Filiae filiae meae et filii filii mei et greges greges mei et omnia, quae cernis, mea sunt; et filiabus meis quid possum facere illis hodie et filiis earum, quos genuerunt?
<br>Veni ergo, et ineamus foedus ego et tu, ut sit in testimonium inter me et te ”.
<br>Tulit itaque Iacob lapidem et erexit illum in titulum;
<br>dixitque fratribus suis: “ Afferte lapides ”. Qui congregantes fecerunt tumulum comederuntque ibi super eum.
<br>Quem vocavit Laban Iegarsahadutha (id est Tumulus testimonii), et Iacob Galed (uterque iuxta proprietatem linguae suae).
<br>Dixitque Laban: “ Tumulus iste testis erit inter me et te hodie ”; et idcirco appellatum est nomen eius Galed (id est Tumulus testis)
<br>et etiam Maspha (id est Specula), quia dixit: “ Speculetur Dominus inter me et te, quando absconditi erimus ab invicem.
<br>Si afflixeris filias meas et si introduxeris uxores alias super eas, cum nemo nobiscum sit, vide, Deus est testis inter me et te ”.
<br>Dixitque Laban ad Iacob: “ En tumulus hic et lapis, quem erexi inter me et te.
<br>Testis erit tumulus iste et lapis quod ego non transibo tumulum hunc pergens ad te, neque tu transibis tumulum hunc et lapidem hunc ad malum.
<br>Deus Abraham et Deus Nachor iudicent inter nos ”.<br>
Iuravit Iacob per Timorem patris sui Isaac;
<br>immolatisque victimis in monte, vocavit fratres suos, ut ederent panem. Qui cum comedissent, pernoctaverunt in monte.

<br>Laban vero de nocte consurgens osculatus est filios et filias suas et benedixit illis reversusque est in locum suum.
<br>Iacob quoque abiit itinere, quo coeperat, fueruntque ei obviam angeli Dei.
<br>Quos cum vidisset, ait: “ Castra Dei sunt haec ”; et appellavit nomen loci illius Mahanaim (id est Castra).
<br>Misit autem nuntios ante se ad Esau fratrem suum in terram Seir, in regionem Edom.
<br>Praecepitque eis dicens: “ Sic loquimini domino meo Esau: Haec dicit servus tuus Iacob: Apud Laban peregrinatus sum et fui usque in praesentem diem.
<br>Habeo boves et asinos, oves et servos atque ancillas; mittoque nunc legationem ad dominum meum, ut inveniam gratiam in conspectu tuo ”.
<br>Reversique sunt nuntii ad Iacob dicentes: “ Venimus ad Esau fratrem tuum, et ecce properat in occursum tibi cum quadringentis viris ”.
<br>Timuit Iacob valde et perterritus divisit populum, qui secum erat, greges quoque et oves et boves et camelos in duas turmas
<br>dicens: “ Si venerit Esau ad unam turmam et percusserit eam, alia turma, quae reliqua est, salvabitur ”.
<br>Dixitque Iacob: “ Deus patris mei Abraham et Deus patris mei Isaac, Domine, qui dixisti mihi: "Revertere in terram tuam et in locum nativitatis tuae, et benefaciam tibi",
<br>minor sum cunctis miserationibus et cuncta veritate, quam explesti servo tuo. In baculo meo transivi Iordanem istum et nunc cum duabus turmis regredior.
<br>Erue me de manu fratris mei, de manu Esau, quia valde eum timeo; ne forte veniens percutiat matrem cum filiis.
<br>Tu locutus es quod bene mihi faceres et dilatares semen meum sicut arenam maris, quae prae multitudine numerari non potest ”.
<br>Mansit ibi nocte illa et sumpsit de his, quae habebat, munera Esau fratri suo:
<br>capras ducentas, hircos viginti, oves ducentas et arietes viginti,
<br>camelos fetas cum pullis suis triginta, vaccas quadraginta et tauros decem, asinas viginti et pullos earum decem.
<br>Et misit per manus servorum suorum singulos seorsum greges dixitque pueris suis: “ Antecedite me, et sit spatium inter gregem et gregem ”.
<br>Et praecepit priori dicens: “ Si obvium habueris Esau fratrem meum, et interrogaverit te: "Cuius es?" et "Quo vadis?" et "Cuius sunt ista, quae sequeris?",
<br>respondebis: Servi tui Iacob; munera misit domino meo Esau. Ipse quoque post nos venit ”.
<br>Similiter mandata dedit secundo ac tertio et cunctis, qui sequebantur greges, dicens: “ Iisdem verbis loquimini ad Esau, cum inveneritis eum,
<br>et addetis: Ipse quoque servus tuus Iacob iter nostrum insequitur. Dixit enim: Placabo illum muneribus, quae praecedunt, et postea videbo faciem eius: forsitan propitiabitur mihi ”.
<br>Praecesserunt itaque munera ante eum, ipse vero mansit nocte illa in castris.
<br>Cumque nocte surrexisset, tulit duas uxores suas et totidem famulas cum undecim filiis et transivit vadum Iaboc;
<br>sumptis ergo traductisque illis et omnibus, quae ad se pertinebant, per torrentem,
<br>mansit solus.<br>
Et ecce vir luctabatur cum eo usque mane.
<br>Qui cum videret quod eum superare non posset, tetigit acetabulum femoris eius, et statim luxatum est acetabulum femoris Iacob, cum luctaretur cum illo.
<br>Dixitque: “ Dimitte me, iam enim ascendit aurora ”. Respondit: “ Non dimittam te, nisi benedixeris mihi ”.
<br>Ait ad eum: “ Quod nomen est tibi? ”. Respondit: “ Iacob ”.
<br>At ille: “ Nequaquam, inquit, Iacob amplius appellabitur nomen tuum, sed Israel: quoniam certasti cum Deo et cum hominibus et praevaluisti! ”.
<br>Interrogavit eum Iacob: “ Dic mihi, quo appellaris nomine? ”. Respondit: “ Cur quaeris nomen meum? ”. Et benedixit ei in eodem loco.
<br>Vocavitque Iacob nomen loci illius Phanuel dicens: “ Vidi Deum facie ad faciem, et salva facta est anima mea ”.
<br>Ortusque est ei sol, cum transgrederetur Phanuel; ipse vero claudicabat propter femur.
<br>Quam ob causam non comedunt filii Israel nervum, qui est in femore, usque in praesentem diem, eo quod tetigerit nervum femoris Iacob.

<br>Elevans autem Iacob oculos suos vidit venientem Esau et cum eo quadringentos viros; divisitque filios Liae et Rachel ambarumque famularum.
<br>Et posuit utramque ancillam et liberos earum in principio, Liam vero et filios eius in secundo loco, Rachel autem et Ioseph novissimos.
<br>Et ipse praegrediens adoravit pronus in terram septies, donec appropinquaret ad fratrem suum.
<br>Currens itaque Esau obviam fratri suo amplexatus est eum; stringensque collum eius osculatus est eum, et fleverunt.
<br>Levatisque oculis, vidit mulieres et liberos earum et ait: “ Qui sunt isti tibi? ”. Respondit: “ Liberi sunt, quos donavit mihi Deus servo tuo ”.
<br>Et appropinquantes ancillae et filii earum incurvati sunt.
<br>Accessit quoque Lia cum liberis suis et, cum similiter adorassent, extremi Ioseph et Rachel adoraverunt.
<br>“ Quaenam sunt, inquit, istae turmae, quas obvias habui? ”. Respondit: “ Ut invenirem gratiam coram domino meo ”.
<br>At ille: “ Habeo, ait, plurima, frater mi; sint tua tibi ”.
<br>Dixit Iacob: “ Noli ita, obsecro; sed, si inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, accipe munusculum de manibus meis; sic enim vidi faciem tuam quasi viderim vultum Dei, et mihi propitius fuisti.
<br>Suscipe, quaeso, benedictionem, quae allata est tibi; quia Deus misertus est mihi, et habeo omnia ”.<br>
Et, cum compelleret illum, suscepit
<br>et ait: “ Gradiamur simul, eroque socius itineris tui ”.
<br>Dixit Iacob: “ Nosti, domine mi, quod parvulos habeam teneros et oves et boves fetas mecum; quas si plus in ambulando fecero laborare vel una die, morientur cuncti greges.
<br>Praecedat dominus meus ante servum suum; et ego sequar paulatim secundum gressum pecorum ante me et secundum gressum parvulorum, donec veniam ad dominum meum in Seir ”.
<br>Respondit Esau: “ Oro te, ut de populo, qui mecum est, saltem socii remaneant viae tuae”. “ Non est, inquit, necesse; hoc uno indigeo, ut inveniam gratiam in conspectu domini mei ”.
<br>Reversus est itaque illo die Esau itinere suo in Seir.
<br>Et Iacob venit in Succoth, ubi, aedificata sibi domo et fixis tentoriis pro gregibus suis, appellavit nomen loci illius Succoth (id est Tabernacula).
<br>Transivitque Iacob incolumis ad urbem Sichem, quae est in terra Chanaan, cum veniret de Paddanaram; et habitavit iuxta oppidum.
<br>Emitque partem agri, in qua fixerat tabernaculum suum, a filiis Hemmor patris Sichem centum argenteis.
<br>Et erexit ibi altare et vocavit illud: “ Deus est Deus Israel ”.

<br>Egressa est autem Dina filia, quam Lia pepererat Iacob, ut videret filias regionis illius.
<br>Quam cum vidisset Sichem filius Hemmor Hevaei principis terrae illius, adamavit eam et rapuit; et dormivit cum illa, vi opprimens illam.
<br>Et conglutinata est anima eius cum ea, et amavit puellam et locutus est ad cor eius.
<br>Dixitque ad Hemmor patrem suum: “ Accipe mihi puellam hanc coniugem ”.
<br>Cum audisset Iacob quod violasset Dinam filiam suam, absentibus filiis et in pastu pecorum occupatis, siluit, donec redirent.
<br>Egresso autem Hemmor patre Sichem, ut loqueretur ad Iacob,
<br>ecce filii Iacob veniebant de agro, auditoque, quod acciderat, contristati et irati sunt valde, eo quod foedam rem esset operatus in Israel et, violata filia Iacob, rem illicitam perpetrasset.
<br>Locutus est itaque Hemmor ad eos: “ Sichem filii mei adhaesit anima filiae vestrae; date eam illi uxorem,
<br>et iungamus vicissim conubia: filias vestras tradite nobis et filias nostras accipite vobis.
<br>Et habitate nobiscum; terra in potestate vestra est: manete, perambulate et possidete eam ”.
<br>Sed et Sichem ad patrem et ad fratres eius ait: “ Inveniam gratiam coram vobis et, quaecumque statueritis, dabo.
<br>Augete mihi valde dotem et munera; libens tribuam, quod petieritis. Tantum date mihi puellam hanc uxorem ”.
<br>Responderunt filii Iacob Sichem et Hemmor patri eius in dolo ob stuprum sororis:
<br>“ Non possumus facere, quod petitis, dare sororem nostram homini incircumciso, opprobrium enim esset nobis.
<br>In hoc tantum valebimus acquiescere vobis: si esse volueritis similes nostri, circumcidatur in vobis omne masculini sexus;
<br>tunc dabimus et accipiemus mutuo filias nostras ac vestras et habitabimus vobiscum erimusque unus populus.
<br>Si autem circumcidi nolueritis, tollemus filiam nostram et recedemus ”.
<br>Placuit oblatio eorum Hemmor et Sichem filio eius,
<br>nec distulit adulescens quin statim, quod petebatur, expleret; amabat enim filiam Iacob valde, et ipse erat inclitus in omni domo patris sui.
<br>Ingressique portam urbis, Hemmor et Sichem filius eius locuti sunt ad viros civitatis suae:
<br>“ Viri isti pacifici sunt erga nos; maneant in terra et perambulent eam, quae spatiosa et lata est eis; filias eorum accipiemus uxores et nostras illis dabimus.
<br>Tantum in hoc valebunt viri acquiescere nobis, ut maneant nobiscum et efficiamur unus populus, si circumcidamus masculos nostros ritum gentis imitantes;
<br>et pecora et substantia et armenta eorum nostra erunt. Tantum in hoc acquiescamus, et habitabunt nobiscum ”.
<br>Assensique sunt omnes, circumcisis cunctis maribus, qui egrediebantur e porta civitatis suae.
<br>Et ecce, die tertio, quando gravissimus vulnerum dolor est, arreptis duo filii Iacob Simeon et Levi fratres Dinae gladiis, ingressi sunt urbem securi; interfectisque omnibus masculis,
<br>Hemmor et Sichem pariter necaverunt, tollentes Dinam de domo Sichem sororem suam.
<br>Filii Iacob irruerunt super occisos, et depopulati sunt urbem in ultionem stupri.
<br>Oves eorum et armenta et asinos cunctaque, quae in civitate et in agris erant, tulerunt.
<br>Omnes opes eorum, parvulos quoque et uxores duxerunt captivas et diripuerunt omnia, quae in domibus erant.
<br>Iacob autem dixit ad Simeon et Levi: “ Turbastis me et odiosum fecistis me Chananaeis et Pherezaeis habitatoribus terrae huius. Nos pauci sumus; illi congregati percutient me, et delebor ego et domus mea ”.
<br>Responderunt: “ Numquid ut scorto abuti debuere sorore nostra? ”.

<br>Locutus est Deus ad Iacob: “ Surge et ascende Bethel et habita ibi; facque altare Deo, qui apparuit tibi, quando fugiebas Esau fratrem tuum ”.
<br>Iacob vero, convocata omni domo sua, ait: “ Abigite deos alienos, qui in medio vestri sunt, et mundamini ac mutate vestimenta vestra.
<br>Surgamus et ascendamus in Bethel, ut faciamus ibi altare Deo, qui exaudivit me in die tribulationis meae et socius fuit itineris mei ”.
<br>Dederunt ergo ei omnes deos alienos, quos habebant, et inaures, quae erant in auribus eorum; at ille infodit ea subter Quercum, quae est prope urbem Sichem.
<br>Cumque profecti essent, terror Dei invasit omnes per circuitum civitates, et non sunt ausi persequi filios Iacob.
<br>Venit igitur Iacob Luzam, quae est in terra Chanaan, id est Bethel, ipse et omnis populus cum eo.
<br>Aedificavitque ibi altare et appellavit nomen loci illius Deus Bethel; ibi enim apparuit ei Deus, cum fugeret fratrem suum.
<br>Eodem tempore mortua est Debora nutrix Rebeccae et sepulta est ad radices Bethel subter quercum; vocatumque est nomen loci illius Quercus fletus.
<br>Apparuit iterum Deus Iacob, postquam reversus est de Paddanaram, benedixitque ei
<br>dicens: “ Non vocaberis ultra Iacob, sed Israel erit nomen tuum ”, et appellavit eum Israel.
<br>Dixitque ei: “ Ego Deus omnipotens. Cresce et multiplicare; gens et congregatio nationum erunt ex te, reges de lumbis tuis egredientur.
<br>Terramque, quam dedi Abraham et Isaac, dabo tibi; et semini tuo post te dabo terram hanc ”.
<br>Et ascendit ab eo Deus.
<br>Ille vero erexit titulum lapideum in loco, quo locutus ei fuerat Deus, libans super eum libamina et effundens oleum
<br>vocansque nomen loci illius Bethel.
<br>Egressi sunt de Bethel. Et adhuc spatium quoddam erat usque ad Ephratham, cum parturiret Rachel;
<br>ob difficultatem partus periclitari coepit, dixitque ei obstetrix: “ Noli timere, quia et hac vice habes filium ”.
<br>Egrediente autem anima et imminente iam morte, vocavit nomen filii sui Benoni (id est Filius doloris mei); pater vero appellavit eum Beniamin (id est Filius dextrae).
<br>Mortua est ergo Rachel et sepulta est in via, quae ducit Ephratham; haec est Bethlehem.
<br>Erexitque Iacob titulum super sepulcrum eius; hic est titulus monumenti Rachel usque in praesentem diem.
<br>Egressus inde Israel, fixit tabernaculum trans Magdaleder (id est Turris gregis).
<br>Cumque habitaret in illa regione, abiit Ruben et dormivit cum Bilha concubina patris sui; quod illum minime latuit.<br>
Erant autem filii Iacob duodecim.
<br>Filii Liae: primogenitus Ruben et Simeon et Levi et Iudas et Issachar et Zabulon.
<br>Filii Rachel: Ioseph et Beniamin.
<br>Filii Bilhae ancillae Rachelis: Dan et Nephthali.
<br>Filii Zelphae ancillae Liae: Gad et Aser. Hi sunt filii Iacob, qui nati sunt ei in Paddanaram.
<br>Venit Iacob ad Isaac patrem suum in Mambre Cariatharbe, id est Hebron, ubi peregrinatus est Abraham et Isaac.
<br>Et completi sunt dies Isaac centum octoginta annorum;
<br>consumptusque aetate mortuus est et appositus est populo suo senex et plenus dierum. Et sepelierunt eum Esau et Iacob filii sui.<br>

<br>Esau accepit uxores de filiabus Chanaan: Ada filiam Elon Hetthaei et Oolibama filiam Ana filii Sebeon Horraei;
<br>Basemath quoque filiam Ismael sororem Nabaioth.
<br>Peperit autem Ada Eliphaz, Basemath genuit Rahuel,

Hi filii Esau, qui nati sunt ei in terra Chanaan.
<br>Tulit autem Esau uxores suas et filios et filias et omnes animas domus suae et pecora armenta et cuncta, quae acquisierat in terra Chanaan, et abiit in terram Seir; recessitque a fratre suo Iacob.
<br>Divites enim erant valde et simul habitare non poterant; nec sustinebat eos terra peregrinationis eorum prae multitudine gregum.
<br>Habitavitque Esau in monte Seir. Ipse est Edom.
<br>Hae autem sunt generationes Esau patris Edom in monte Seir,
<br>et haec nomina filiorum eius: Eliphaz filius Ada uxoris Esau, Rahuel quoque filius Basemath uxoris eius.

<br>Cumque mortuus esset Adad, regnavit pro eo Semla de Masreca.
<br>Hoc quoque mortuo, regnavit pro eo Saul de Rohoboth iuxta fluvium.

<br>Habitavit autem Iacob in terra Chanaan, in qua peregrinatus est pater suus.
<br>Hae sunt generationes Iacob.<br>
Ioseph, cum decem et scptem esset annorum, pascebat gregem cum fratribus suis adhuc puer; et erat cum filiis Bilhae et Zelphae uxorum patris sui; detulitque patri malam eorum famam.
<br>Israel autem diligebat Ioseph super omnes filios suos, eo quod in senectute genuisset eum; fecitque ei tunicam talarem.
<br>Videntes autem fratres eius quod a patre plus cunctis filiis amaretur, oderant eum nec poterant ei quidquam pacifice loqui.
<br>Accidit quoque ut visum somnium referret fratribus suis; quae causa maioris odii seminarium fuit.
<br>Dixitque ad eos: “ Audite somnium meum, quod vidi.
<br>Putabam ligare nos manipulos in agro, et quasi consurgere manipulum meum et stare, vestrosque manipulos circumstantes adorare manipulum meum ”.
<br>Responderunt fratres eius: “ Numquid rex noster eris? Aut subiciemur dicioni tuae? ”. Haec ergo causa somniorum atque sermonum, invidiae et odii fomitem ministravit.
<br>Aliud quoque vidit somnium, quod narrans fratribus ait: “ Vidi per somnium quasi solem et lunam et stellas undecim adorare me ”.
<br>Quod cum patri suo et fratribus retulisset, increpavit eum pater suus et dixit: “ Quid sibi vult hoc somnium, quod vidisti? Num ego et mater tua et fratres tui adorabimus te proni in terram? ”.
<br>Invidebant igitur ei fratres sui; pater vero rem tacitus considerabat.
<br>Cumque fratres illius in pascendis gregibus patris morarentur in Sichem,
<br>dixit Israel ad Ioseph: “ Fratres tui pascunt oves in Sichimis; veni, mittam te ad eos ”. Quo respondente:
<br>“ Praesto sum ”, ait ei: “ Vade et vide, si cuncta prospera sint erga fratres tuos et pecora, et renuntia mihi quid agatur ”. Missus de valle Hebron venit in Sichem;
<br>invenitque eum vir errantem in agro et interrogavit quid quaereret.
<br>At ille respondit: “ Fratres meos quaero; indica mihi, ubi pascant greges ”.
<br>Dixitque ei vir: “ Recesserunt de loco isto; audivi autem eos dicentes: "Eamus in Dothain" ”. Perrexit ergo Ioseph post fratres suos et invenit eos in Dothain.
<br>Qui cum vidissent eum procul, antequam accederet ad eos, cogitaverunt illum occidere.
<br>Et mutuo loquebantur: “ Ecce somniator venit;
<br>venite, occidamus eum et mittamus in unam cisternarum dicemusque: Fera pessima devoravit eum. Et tunc apparebit quid illi prosint somnia sua ”.
<br>Audiens autem hoc Ruben nitebatur liberare eum de manibus eorum et dixit:
<br>“ Non interficiamus animam eius ”. Et dixit ad eos: “ Non effundatis sanguinem; sed proicite eum in cisternam hanc, quae est in solitudine, manusque vestras servate innoxias ”. Hoc autem dicebat volens eripere eum de manibus eorum et reddere patri suo.
<br>Confestim igitur, ut pervenit ad fratres suos, nudaverunt eum tunica talari
<br>miseruntque eum in cisternam, quae non habebat aquam.
<br>Et sederunt, ut comederent panem. Attollentes autem oculos viderunt Ismaelitas viatorcs venire de Galaad et camelos eorum portantes tragacanthum et masticem et ladanum in Aegyptum.
<br>Dixit ergo Iudas fratribus suis: “ Quid nobis prodest, si occiderimus fratrem nostrum et celaverimus sanguinem ipsius?
<br>Melius est ut vendatur Ismaelitis, et manus nostrae non polluantur; frater enim et caro nostra est ”. Acquieverunt fratres sermonibus illius.
<br>Et praetereuntibus Madianitis negotiatoribus, extrahentes Ioseph de cisterna, vendiderunt eum Ismaelitis viginti argenteis. Qui duxerunt eum in Aegyptum.
<br>Reversusque Ruben ad cisternam non invenit puerum
<br>et, scissis vestibus, pergens ad fratres suos ait: “ Puer non comparet, et ego quo ibo? ”.
<br>Tulerunt autem tunicam eius et in sanguinem haedi, quem occiderant, tinxerunt
<br>mittentes, qui ferrent ad patrem et dicerent: “Hanc invenimus; vide, utrum tunica talaris filii tui sit an non? ”.
<br>Quam cum agnovisset pater, ait: “ Tunica filii mei est; fera pessima comedit eum, bestia devoravit Ioseph ”.
<br>Scissisque vestibus, indutus est cilicio lugens filium suum multo tempore.
<br>Congregatis autem cunctis liberis eius, ut lenirent dolorem patris, noluit consolationem accipere et ait: “ Descendam ad filium meum lugens in infernum ”. Et flevit super eo pater eius.
<br>Madianitae autem vendiderunt Ioseph in Aegypto Putiphari eunucho pharaonis, magistro satellitum.

<br>Eo tempore descendens Iudas a fratribus suis divertit ad virum Odollamitem nomine Hiram.
<br>Viditque ibi filiam hominis Chananaei vocabulo Sue et, accepta uxore, ingressus est ad eam.
<br>Quae concepit et peperit filium vocavitque nomen eius Her.
<br>Rursumque concepto fetu, natum filium nominavit Onan.
<br>Tertium quoque peperit, quem appellavit Sela. Ipsa autem erat in Chasib, quando peperit illum.
<br>Dedit autem Iudas uxorem primogenito suo Her nomine Thamar.
<br>Fuit quoque Her primogenitus Iudae nequam in conspectu Domini, et ab eo occisus est.
<br>Dixit ergo Iudas ad Onan: “ Ingredere ad uxorem fratris tui et sociare illi, ut suscites semen fratri tuo ”.
<br>Ille, sciens non sibi nasci hunc filium, introiens ad uxorem fratris sui semen fundebat in terram, ne proles fratris nomine nasceretur.
<br>Et idcirco occidit et eum Dominus, quod rem detestabilem fecerat.
<br>Quam ob rem dixit Iudas Thamar nurui suae: “ Esto vidua in domo patris tui, donec crescat Sela filius meus ”. Timebat, enim, ne et ipse moreretur sicut fratres eius. Quae abiit et habitavit in domo patris sui.
<br>Evolutis autem multis diebus, mortua est filia Sue uxor Iudae. Qui, post luctum consolatione suscepta, ascendebat ad tonsores ovium suarum ipse et Hiras amicus suus Odollamites in Thamnam.
<br>Nuntiatumque est Thamar quod socer illius ascenderet in Thamnam ad tondendas oves.
<br>Quae, depositis viduitatis vestibus, cooperuit se velo et, mutato habitu, sedit in porta Enaim in via, quae ducit Thamnam; eo quod crevisset Sela, et non eum accepisset maritum.
<br>Quam cum vidisset Iudas, suspicatus est esse meretricem; operuerat enim vultum suum.
<br>Declinansque ad eam in via ait: “ Veni, coeam tecum ”; nesciebat enim quod nurus sua esset. Qua respondente: “ Quid mihi dabis, ut fruaris concubitu meo? ”,
<br>dixit: “ Mittam tibi haedum de gregibus ”. Rursum illa dicente: “ Si dederis mihi arrabonem, donec mittas illum ”,
<br>ait Iudas: “ Quid vis tibi pro arrabone dari? ”. Respondit: “ Sigillum tuum et funiculum et baculum, quem manu tenes ”. Et dedit ei. In coitu cum eo mulier concepit
<br>et surgens abiit; depositoque velo, induta est viduitatis vestibus.
<br>Misit autem Iudas haedum per amicum suum Odollamitem, ut reciperet pignus, quod dederat mulieri. Qui cum non invenisset eam,
<br>interrogavit homines loci illius: “ Ubi est meretrix, quae sedebat in Enaim in via? ”. Respondentibus cunctis: “ Non fuit in loco isto meretrix ”,
<br>reversus est ad Iudam et dixit ei: “ Non inveni eam; sed et homines loci illius dixerunt mihi numquam ibi sedisse scortum ”.
<br>Ait Iudas: “ Habeat sibi; ne simus in ludibrium. Ego misi haedum, quem promiseram, et tu non invenisti eam ”.
<br>Ecce autem post tres menses nuntiaverunt Iudae dicentes: “ Fornicata est Thamar nurus tua et gravida est ex fornicatione ”. Dixitque Iudas: “ Producite eam, ut comburatur ”.
<br>Quae cum educeretur ad poenam, misit ad socerum suum dicens: “ De viro, cuius haec sunt, concepi; cognosce cuius sit sigillum et funiculus et baculus ”.
<br>Qui, agnitis pignoribus, ait: “ Iustior me est, quia non tradidi eam Sela filio meo ”. Attamen ultra non cognovit illam.
<br>Instante autem partu, apparuerunt gemini in utero; atque in ipsa effusione infantium unus protulit manum, in qua obstetrix ligavit coccinum dicens:
<br>“ Iste egressus est prior ”.
<br>Illo vero retrahente manum, egressus est frater eius; dixitque mulier: “ Qualem rupisti tibi rupturam? ”. Et ob hanc causam vocatum est nomen eius Phares (id est Ruptura).
<br>Postea egressus est frater eius, in cuius manu erat coccinum; qui appellatus est Zara (id est Ortus solis).

<br>Igitur Ioseph ductus est in Aegyptum; emitque eum Putiphar eunuchus pharaonis, princeps satellitum, vir Aegyptius, de manu Ismaelitarum, a quibus perductus erat.
<br>Fuitque Dominus cum eo, et erat vir in cunctis prospere agens habitabatque in domo domini sui.
<br>Qui optime noverat esse Dominum cum eo et omnia, quae gereret, ab eo dirigi in manu illius.
<br>Invenitque loseph gratiam coram domino suo et ministrabat ei. Et factum est, postquam praeposuit eum domui suae et omnia, quae possidebat, tradidit in manum eius,
<br>benedixit Dominus domui Aegyptii propter Ioseph, et benedictio Domini erat in omni possessione eius tam in aedibus quam in agris.
<br>Et reliquit omnia, quae possidebat, in manu Ioseph nec cum eo quidquam aliud noverat nisi panem, quo vescebatur. Erat autem Ioseph pulchra facie et decorus aspectu.
<br>Post haec ergo iniecit uxor domini eius oculos suos in Ioseph et ait: “ Dormi mecum ”.
<br>Qui nequaquam acquiescens dixit ad eam: “ Ecce dominus meus, omnibus mihi traditis, non curat de ulla re in domo sua,
<br>nec quisquam maior est in domo hac quam ego, et nihil mihi subtraxit praeter te, quae uxor eius es. Quomodo ergo possum malum hoc magnum facere et peccare in Deum? ”.
<br>Huiuscemodi verbis per singulos dies et mulier molesta erat adulescenti, et ille recusabat stuprum.
<br>Accidit autem quadam die, ut intraret Ioseph domum et opus suum absque arbitris faceret;
<br>illa, apprehensa lacinia vestimenti eius, dixit: “ Dormi mecum ”. Qui, relicto in manu illius pallio, fugit et egressus est foras.
<br>Cumque vidisset illum mulier vestem reliquisse in manibus suis et fugisse foras,
<br>vocavit homines domus suae et ait ad eos: “ En introduxit virum Hebraeum, ut illuderet nobis; ingressus est ad me, ut coiret mecum. Cumque ego succlamassem,
<br>et audisset vocem meam, reliquit pallium, quod tenebam, et fugit foras ”.
<br>Retentum pallium ostendit marito revertenti domum
<br>et secundum verba haec locuta est: “ Ingressus est ad me servus Hebraeus, quem adduxisti, ut illuderet mihi;
<br>cumque audisset me clamare, reliquit pallium, quod tenebam, et fugit foras ”.
<br>Dominus, auditis his verbis coniugis, iratus est valde;
<br>tradiditque Ioseph in carcerem, ubi vincti regis custodiebantur. Et erat ibi clausus.
<br>Fuit autem Dominus cum Ioseph et misertus illius dedit ei gratiam in conspectu principis carceris.
<br>Qui tradidit in manu Ioseph universos vinctos, qui in custodia tenebantur, et, quidquid ibi faciendum erat, ipse faciebat,
<br>nec princeps carceris spectabat quidquid in manu eius erat: Dominus enim erat cum illo et omnia opera eius dirigebat.

<br>His ita gestis, accidit ut peccarent pincerna regis Aegypti et pistor domino suo.
<br>Iratusque pharao contra duos eunuchos, praepositum pincernarum et praepositum pistorum,
<br>misit eos in carcerem principis satellitum, in quo erat vinctus et Ioseph.
<br>Et princeps satellitum tradidit eos Ioseph, qui ministrabat eis. Aliquantulum temporis illi in custodia tenebantur.
<br>Videruntque ambo somnium nocte una iuxta interpretationem congruam sibi.
<br>Ad quos cum introisset Ioseph mane et vidisset eos tristes,
<br>sciscitatus est eos dicens: “ Cur tristior est hodie solito facies vestra? ”.
<br>Qui responderunt: “ Somnium vidimus, et non est qui interpretetur nobis ”. Dixitque ad eos Ioseph: “ Numquid non Dei est interpretatio? Referte mihi quid videritis ”.
<br>Narravit praepositus pincernarum somnium suum: “ Videbam coram me vitem,
<br>in qua erant tres propagines, crescere paulatim in gemmas et post flores uvas maturescere;
<br>calicemque pharaonis in manu mea. Tuli ergo uvas et expressi in calicem, quem tenebam, et tradidi poculum pharaoni ”.
<br>Respondit Ioseph: “ Haec est interpretatio somnii: tres propagines, tres adhuc dies sunt,
<br>post quos elevabit pharao caput tuum et restituet te in gradum pristinum; dabisque ei calicem iuxta officium tuum, sicut facere ante consueveras.
<br>Tantum memento mei, cum tibi bene fuerit, et facias mecum misericordiam, ut suggeras pharaoni, ut educat me de isto carcere;
<br>quia furto sublatus sum de terra Hebraeorum et hic innocens in lacum missus sum ”.
<br>Videns pistorum magister quod somnium in bonum dissolvisset, ait: “ Et ego vidi somnium, quod tria canistra farinae haberem super caput meum;
<br>et in uno canistro, quod erat excelsius, portare me ex omnibus cibis pharaonis, qui fiunt arte pistoria, avesque comedere eos ”.
<br>Respondit Ioseph: “ Haec est interpretatio somnii: tria canistra, tres adhuc dies sunt,
<br>post quos auferet pharao caput tuum ac suspendet te in patibulo, et comedent volucres carnes tuas ”.
<br>Exinde dies tertius natalicius pharaonis erat; qui faciens grande convivium pueris suis elevavit caput magistri pincernarum et caput pistorum principis in medio puerorum suorum;
<br>restituitque alterum in locum suum, ut porrigeret ei poculum,
<br>alterum suspendit in patibulo, sicut interpretatus erat eis Ioseph.
<br>Attamen praepositus pincernarum non est recordatus Ioseph, sed oblitus est interpretis sui.

<br>Post duos annos vidit pharao somnium. Putabat se stare super fluvium,
<br>de quo ascendebant septem boves pulchrae et crassae et pascebantur in locis palustribus.
<br>Aliae quoque septem emergebant post illas de flumine foedae confectaeque macie et stabant in ipsa amnis ripa;
<br>devoraveruntque septem boves pulchras et crassas. Expergefactus pharao
<br>rursum dormivit et vidit alterum somnium. Septem spicae pullulabant in culmo uno plenae atque formosae.
<br>Aliae quoque totidem spicae tenues et percussae vento urente oriebantur
<br>devorantes omnem priorum pulchritudinem. Evigilavit pharao, et ecce erat somnium!
<br>Et, facto mane, pavore perterritus misit ad omnes coniectores Aegypti cunctosque sapientes suos; et accersitis narravit somnium, nec erat qui interpretaretur.
<br>Tunc demum reminiscens pincernarum magister ait: “ Confiteor peccatum meum.
<br>Iratus rex servis suis me et magistrum pistorum retrudi iussit in carcerem principis satellitum,
<br>ubi una nocte uterque vidimus somnium praesagum futurorum.
<br>Erat ibi puer Hebraeus eiusdem ducis satellitum famulus, cui narrantes somnia
<br>audivimus quidquid postea rei probavit eventus. Ego enim redditus sum officio meo, et ille suspensus est in patibulo ”.
<br>Protinus ad regis imperium eductum de carcere Ioseph totonderunt ac, veste mutata, obtulerunt ei.
<br>Cui ille ait: “ Vidi somnia, nec est qui edisserat; quae audivi te sapientissime conicere ”.
<br>Respondit Ioseph: “ Absque me Deus respondebit prospera pharaoni! ”.
<br>Narravit ergo pharao, quod viderat: “ Putabam me stare super ripam fluminis
<br>et septem boves de amne conscendere pulchras nimis et obesis carnibus, quae in pastu paludis virecta carpebant.
<br>Et ecce has sequebantur aliae septem boves in tantum deformes et macilentae, ut numquam tales in terra Aegypti viderim;
<br>quae, devoratis et consumptis prioribus,
<br>nullum saturitatis dedere vestigium; sed simili macie et squalore torpebant. Evigilans, rursus sopore depressus,
<br>vidi somnium: Septem spicae pullulabant in culmo uno plenae atque pulcherrimae.
<br>Aliae quoque septem tenues et percussae vento urente oriebantur e stipula;
<br>quae priorum pulchritudinem devoraverunt. Narravi coniectoribus somnium, et nemo est qui edisserat ”.
<br>Respondit Ioseph: “ Somnium regis unum est: quae facturus est, Deus ostendit pharaoni.
<br>Septem boves pulchrae et septem spicae plenae septem ubertatis anni sunt; eandemque vim somnii comprehendunt.
<br>Septem quoque boves tenues atque macilentae, quae ascenderunt post eas, et septem spicae tenues et vento urente percussae septem anni sunt venturae famis,
<br>qui hoc ordine complebuntur:
<br>ecce septem anni venient fertilitatis magnae in universa terra Aegypti;
<br>quos sequentur septem anni alii tantae sterilitatis, ut oblivioni tradatur cuncta retro abundantia. Consumptura est enim fames omnem terram,
<br>et ubertatis magnitudinem perditura est inopiae magnitudo.
<br>Quod autem vidisti secundo ad eandem rem pertinens somnium, firmitatis indicium est, eo quod fiat sermo Dei et velocius a Deo impleatur.
<br>Nunc ergo provideat rex virum intellegentem et sapientem et praeficiat eum terrae Aegypti
<br>constituatque praepositos per cunctas regiones et quintam partem fructuum per septem annos fertilitatis,
<br>qui iam nunc futuri sunt, congreget in horrea; et omne frumentum sub pharaonis potestate condatur serveturque in urbibus;
<br>et paretur futurae septem annorum fami, quae pressura est Aegyptum, et non consumetur terra inopia ”.
<br>Placuit pharaoni consilium et cunctis ministris eius.
<br>Locutusque est ad eos: “ Num invenire poterimus talem virum, qui spiritu Dei plenus sit? ”.
<br>Dixit ergo ad Ioseph: “ Quia ostendit tibi Deus omnia, quae locutus es, numquid sapientiorem et consimilem tui invenire potero?
<br>Tu eris super domum meam, et ad tui oris imperium cunctus populus meus oboediet; uno tantum regni solio te praecedam ”.
<br>Dixitque rursus pharao ad Ioseph: “ Ecce, constitui te super universam terram Aegypti ”.
<br>Tulitque anulum de manu sua et dedit eum in manu eius; vestivitque eum stola byssina et collo torquem auream circumposuit.
<br>Fecitque eum ascendere super currum suum secundum, clamante praecone: “ Abrech! ”, ut omnes coram eo genuflecterent et praepositum esse scirent universae terrae Aegypti.
<br>Dixit quoque rex ad Ioseph: “ Ego sum pharao; absque tuo imperio non movebit quisquam manum aut pedem in omni terra Aegypti ”.
<br>Vertitque nomen eius et vocavit eum lingua Aegyptiaca Saphaneth Phanec (quod interpretatur Salvator mundi) deditque illi uxorem Aseneth filiam Putiphare sacerdotis Heliopoleos.<br>
Egressus est itaque Ioseph ad terram Aegypti
<br>­ triginta autem annorum erat quando stetit in conspectu regis pharaonis ­ et circuivit omnes regiones Aegypti.
<br>Venitque fertilitas septem annorum, et segetes congregavit in horrea Aegypti
<br>condens in singulis urbibus frumentum camporum in circuitu.
<br>Tantaque fuit abundantia tritici, ut arenae maris coaequaretur, et copia mensuram excederet.
<br>Nati sunt autem Ioseph filii duo, antequam veniret fames, quos ei peperit Aseneth filia Putiphare sacerdotis Heliopoleos.
<br>Vocavitque nomen primogeniti Manasses dicens: “ Oblivisci me fecit Deus omnium laborum meorum et domus patris mei ”.
<br>Nomen quoque secundi appellavit Ephraim dicens: “ Crescere me fecit Deus in terra paupertatis meae ”.
<br>Igitur, transactis septem annis ubertatis, qui fuerant in Aegypto,
<br>coeperunt venire septem anni inopiae, quos praedixerat Ioseph, et in universo orbe fames praevaluit; in cuncta autem terra Aegypti erat panis.
<br>Qua esuriente, clamavit populus ad pharaonem alimenta petens. Quibus ille respondit: “ Ite ad Ioseph et, quidquid vobis dixerit, facite ”.
<br>Et invaluit fames in omni terra Aegypti; aperuitque Ioseph universa horrea et vendebat Aegyptiis; nam et illos oppresserat fames.
<br>Omnesque provinciae veniebant in Aegyptum, ut emerent escas apud Ioseph, quia inopia invaluerat in universa terra.<br>

<br>Audiens autem Iacob quod alimenta venderentur in Aegypto, dixit filiis suis: “ Quare aspicitis vos invicem?
<br>Audivi quod triticum venumdetur in Aegypto; descendite et emite nobis necessaria, ut possimus vivere et non consumamur inopia ”.
<br>Descenderunt igitur fratres Ioseph decem, ut emerent frumenta in Aegypto,
<br>Beniamin fratre Ioseph domi retento a Iacob, qui dixerat fratribus eius: “ Ne forte in itinere quidquam patiatur mali ”.
<br>Et ingressi sunt filii Israel terram Aegypti cum aliis, qui pergebant ad emendum. Erat autem fames in terra Chanaan.
<br>Et Ioseph erat princeps in terra Aegypti, atque ad eius nutum frumenta populis vendebantur. Cumque venissent et adorassent eum fratres sui proni in terram,
<br>et agnovisset eos, quasi ad alienos durius loquebatur interrogans eos: “ Unde venistis? ”. Qui responderunt: “ De terra Chanaan, ut emamus victui necessaria ”.
<br>Et tamen fratres ipse cognoscens non est cognitus ab eis.
<br>Recordatusque somniorum, quae aliquando viderat, ait ad eos: “ Exploratores estis; ut videatis infirmiora terrae, venistis! ”.
<br>Qui dixerunt: “ Non est ita, domine; sed servi tui venerunt, ut emerent cibos.
<br>Omnes filii unius viri sumus; sinceri sumus, nec quidquam famuli tui machinantur mali ”.
<br>Quibus ille respondit: “ Aliter est; immunita terrae huius considerare venistis! ”.
<br>At illi: “ Duodecim, inquiunt, servi tui fratres sumus filii viri unius in terra Chanaan; minimus cum patre nostro est, alius non est super ”.
<br>“ Hoc est, ait, quod locutus sum: exploratores estis!
<br>Iam nunc experimentum vestri capiam: per salutem pharaonis, non egrediemini hinc, donec veniat frater vester minimus!
<br>Mittite ex vobis unum, et adducat eum; vos autem eritis in vinculis, donec probentur, quae dixistis, utrum vera an falsa sint. Alioquin, per salutem pharaonis, exploratores estis! ”.
<br>Tradidit ergo illos custodiae tribus diebus.
<br>Die autem tertio eductis de carcere, ait: “ Facite, quae dixi, et vivetis; Deum enim timeo.
<br>Si sinceri estis, frater vester unus ligetur in carcere; vos autem abite et ferte frumenta, quae emistis, in domos vestras,
<br>et fratrem vestrum minimum ad me adducite, ut possim vestros probare sermones, et non moriamini ”.<br>
Fecerunt, ut dixerat,
<br>et locuti sunt ad invicem: “ Merito haec patimur, quia peccavimus in fratrem nostrum videntes angustiam animae illius, cum deprecaretur nos, et non audivimus. Idcirco venit super nos ista tribulatio ”.
<br>Et Ruben ait: “ Numquid non dixi vobis: Nolite peccare in puerum? Et non audistis me. En sanguis eius exquiritur ”.
<br>Nesciebant autem quod intellegeret Ioseph, eo quod per interpretem loquebatur ad eos.
<br>Avertitque se parumper et flevit; et reversus locutus est ad eos.
<br>Tollensque Simeon et ligans, illis praesentibus, iussit ministris, ut implerent eorum saccos tritico et reponerent pecunias singulorum in sacculis suis, datis supra cibariis in viam. Qui fecerunt ita.
<br>At illi portantes frumenta in asinis suis profecti sunt.
<br>Apertoque unus sacco, ut daret iumento pabulum in deversorio, contemplatus pecuniam in ore sacculi
<br>dixit fratribus suis: “ Reddita est mihi pecunia: en habetur in sacco! ”. Et obstupefacti turbatique mutuo dixerunt: “ Quidnam est hoc, quod fecit nobis Deus? ”.
<br>Veneruntque ad Iacob patrem suum in terram Chanaan; et narraverunt ei omnia, quae accidissent sibi, dicentes:
<br>“ Locutus est nobis dominus terrae dure et putavit nos exploratores esse provinciae ”.
<br>Cui respondimus: “ Sinceri sumus, nec ullas molimur insidias;
<br>duodecim fratres uno patre geniti sumus, unus non est super, minimus cum patre nostro est in terra Chanaan.
<br>Et dixit nobis vir, dominus terrae: "Sic probabo quod sinceri sitis: fratrem vestrum unum dimittite apud me et cibaria domibus vestris necessaria sumite et abite;
<br>fratremque vestrum minimum adducite ad me, ut sciam quod non sitis exploratores et istum, qui tenetur in vinculis, recipere possitis ac deinceps peragrandi terram habeatis licentiam" ”.
<br>His dictis, cum frumenta effunderent, singuli reppererunt in ore saccorum ligatas pecunias; exterritisque simul omnibus,
<br>dixit pater Iacob: “ Absque liberis me esse fecistis: Ioseph non est super, Simeon tenetur in vinculis, et Beniamin auferetis. In me haec omnia mala reciderunt ”.
<br>Cui respondit Ruben: “ Duos filios meos interfice, si non reduxero illum tibi; trade illum in manu mea, et ego eum tibi restituam ”.
<br>At ille: “ Non descendet, inquit, filius meus vobiscum. Frater mortuus est, et ipse solus remansit; si quid ei adversi acciderit in via, deducetis canos meos cum dolore ad inferos”.

<br>Interim fames omnem terram vehementer premebat;
<br>consumptisque cibis, quos ex Aegypto detulerant, dixit Iacob ad filios suos: “ Revertimini et emite nobis pauxillum escarum ”.
<br>Respondit Iudas: “ Denuntiavit nobis vir ille sub attestatione iurisiurandi dicens: "Non videbitis faciem meam, nisi fratrem vestrum minimum adduxeritis vobiscum".
<br>Si ergo vis eum mittere nobiscum, pergemus pariter et ememus tibi necessaria;
<br>sin autem non vis, non ibimus. Vir enim, ut saepe diximus, denuntiavit nobis dicens: "Non videbitis faciem meam absque fratre vestro minimo" ”.
<br>Dixit eis Israel: “ Cur in meam hoc fecistis miseriam, ut indicaretis ei et alium habere vos fratrem? ”.
<br>At illi responderunt: “ Interrogavit nos homo per ordinem nostram progeniem: si pater viveret, si haberemus fratrem; et nos respondimus ei consequenter iuxta id, quod fuerat sciscitatus. Numquid scire poteramus quod dicturus esset: "Adducite fratrem vestrum vobiscum?" ”.
<br>Iudas quoque dixit patri suo Israel: “ Mitte puerum mecum, ut proficiscamur et possimus vivere, ne moriamur nos et tu et parvuli nostri.
<br>Ego spondeo pro puero; de manu mea require illum. Nisi reduxero et reddidero eum tibi, ero peccati reus in te omni tempore.
<br>Si non intercessisset dilatio, iam vice altera venissemus ”.
<br>Igitur Israel pater eorum dixit ad eos: “ Si sic necesse est, facite, quod vultis; sumite de optimis terrae fructibus in vasis vestris et deferte viro munera: modicum resinae et mellis et tragacanthum et ladanum, pistacias terebinthi et amygdalas.
<br>Pecuniam quoque duplicem ferte vobiscum et illam, quam invenistis in sacculis, reportate, ne forte errore factum sit;
<br>sed et fratrem vestrum tollite et ite ad virum.
<br>Deus autem meus omnipotens faciat vobis eum placabilem, et remittat vobiscum fratrem vestrum, quem tenet, et hunc Beniamin. Ego autem quasi orbatus absque liberis ero ”.
<br>Tulerunt ergo viri munera et pecuniam duplicem et Beniamin descenderuntque in Aegyptum; et steterunt coram Ioseph.
<br>Quos cum ille vidisset et Beniamin simul, praecepit dispensatori domus suae dicens: “ Introduc viros domum et occide victimas et instrue convivium, quoniam mecum sunt comesturi meridie ”.
<br>Fecit ille, quod sibi fuerat imperatum, et introduxit viros in domum Ioseph.
<br>Ibique exterriti dixerunt mutuo: “ Propter pecuniam, quam rettulimus prius in saccis nostris, introducti sumus, ut irruant in nos et violenter subiciant servituti et nos et asinos nostros ”.
<br>Quam ob rem in ipsis foribus accedentes ad dispensatorem domus
<br>locuti sunt: “ Oramus, domine, ut audias nos. Iam ante descendimus, ut emeremus escas;
<br>quibus emptis, cum venissemus ad deversorium, aperuimus saccos nostros et invenimus pecuniam in ore saccorum; quam nunc eodem pondere reportavimus.
<br>Sed et aliud attulimus argentum, ut emamus, quae nobis necessaria sunt. Non est in nostra conscientia, quis posuerit argentum in marsupiis nostris ”.
<br>At ille respondit: “ Pax vobiscum, nolite timere. Deus vester et Deus patris vestri dedit vobis thesauros in saccis vestris; nam pecuniam, quam dedistis mihi, probatam ego habeo ”. Eduxitque ad eos Simeon.
<br>Et introductis domum attulit aquam, et laverunt pedes suos; deditque pabulum asinis eorum.
<br>Illi vero parabant munera, donec ingrederetur Ioseph meridie; audierant enim quod ibi comesturi essent panem.
<br>Igitur ingressus est Ioseph domum suam, obtuleruntque ei munera tenentes in manibus suis; et adoraverunt proni in terram.
<br>At ille, clementer resalutatis eis, interrogavit eos dicens: “ Salvusne est pater vester senex, de quo dixeratis mihi? Adhuc vivit? ”.
<br>Qui responderunt: “ Sospes est servus tuus pater noster, adhuc vivit ”. Et incurvati adoraverunt eum.
<br>Attollens autem Ioseph oculos vidit Beniamin fratrem suum uterinum et ait: “ Iste est frater vester parvulus, de quo dixeratis mihi? ”. Et rursum: “ Deus, inquit, misereatur tui, fili mi ”.
<br>Festinavitque, quia commota fuerant viscera eius super fratre suo, et erumpebant lacrimae; et introiens cubiculum flevit.
<br>Rursumque, lota facie, egressus continuit se et ait: “ Ponite panes ”.
<br>Quibus appositis, seorsum Ioseph et seorsum fratribus, Aegyptiis quoque, qui vescebantur simul, seorsum ­ illicitum est enim Aegyptiis comedere cum Hebraeis, et profanum putant huiuscemodi convivium ­
<br>sederunt coram eo, primogenitus iuxta primogenita sua et minimus iuxta aetatem suam. Et mirabantur nimis,
<br>sumptis partibus, quas ab eo acceperant; maiorque pars venit Beniamin, ita ut quinque partibus excederet. Biberuntque et inebriati sunt cum eo.

<br>Praecepit autem Ioseph dispensatori domus suae dicens: “ Imple saccos eorum frumento, quantum possunt capere, et pone pecuniam singulorum in summitate sacci.
<br>Scyphum autem meum argenteum et pretium, quod dedit tritici, pone in ore sacci iunioris ”. Factumque est ita.
<br>Et, orto mane, dimissi sunt cum asinis suis.
<br>Iamque urbem exierant et processerant paululum, tunc Ioseph, arcessito dispensatore domus: “ Surge, inquit, et persequere viros; et apprehensis dicito: "Quare reddidistis malum pro bono? Cur furati estis mihi scyphum argenteum?
<br>Nonne ipse est, in quo bibit dominus meus et in quo augurari solet? Pessimam rem fecistis!" ”.
<br>Fecit ille, ut iusserat, et apprehensis per ordinem locutus est.
<br>Qui responderunt: “ Quare sic loquitur dominus noster? Absit a servis tuis, ut tantum flagitii commiserimus.
<br>Pecuniam, quam invenimus in summitate saccorum, reportavimus ad te de terra Chanaan; et quomodo consequens est, ut furati simus de domo domini tui aurum vel argentum?
<br>Apud quemcumque fuerit inventum servorum tuorum, quod quaeris, moriatur; et nos erimus servi domini nostri ”.
<br>Qui dixit eis: “ Fiat iuxta vestram sententiam: apud quemcumque fuerit inventum, ipse sit servus meus; vos autem eritis innoxii ”.
<br>Itaque festinato deponentes in terram saccos aperuerunt singuli.
<br>Quos scrutatus incipiens a maiore usque ad minimum invenit scyphum in sacco Beniamin.
<br>At illi, scissis vestibus, oneratisque rursum asinis, reversi sunt in oppidum.
<br>Et Iudas cum fratribus ingressus est ad Ioseph ­ necdum enim de loco abierat ­ omnesque ante eum pariter in terram corruerunt.
<br>Quibus ille ait: “ Cur sic agere voluistis? An ignoratis quod non sit similis mei in augurandi scientia? ”.
<br>Cui Iudas: “ Quid respondebimus, inquit, domino meo? Vel quid loquemur aut iuste poterimus obtendere? Deus invenit iniquitatem servorum tuorum; en omnes servi sumus domini mei, et nos et apud quem inventus est scyphus ”.
<br>Respondit Ioseph: “ Absit a me, ut sic agam! Qui furatus est scyphum, ipse sit servus meus; vos autem abite liberi ad patrem vestrum ”.
<br>Accedens autem propius Iudas confidenter ait: “ Oro, domine mi, loquatur servus tuus verbum in auribus tuis, et ne irascaris famulo tuo; tu es enim sicut pharao!
<br>Dominus meus interrogavit prius servos suos: "Habetis patrem aut fratrem?".
<br>Et nos respondimus domino meo: "Est nobis pater senex et puer parvulus, qui in senectute illius natus est, cuius uterinus frater mortuus est; et ipse solus superest a matre sua, pater vero tenere diligit eum" ”.
<br>Dixistique servis tuis: "Adducite eum ad me, et ponam oculos meos super illum".
<br>Suggessimus domino meo: "Non potest puer relinquere patrem suum; si enim illum dimiserit, morietur".
<br>Et dixisti servis tuis: "Nisi venerit frater vester minimus vobiscum, non videbitis amplius faciem meam".
<br>Cum ergo ascendissemus ad famulum tuum patrem nostrum, narravimus ei omnia, quae locutus est dominus meus,
<br>et dixit pater noster: "Revertimini et emite nobis parum tritici".
<br>Cui diximus: "Ire non possumus. Si frater noster minimus descenderit nobiscum, proficiscemur simul; alioquin, illo absente, non poterimus videre faciem viri".
<br>Ad quae servus tuus pater meus respondit: "Vos scitis quod duos genuerit mihi uxor mea.
<br>Egressus est unus a me, et dixi: Bestia devoravit eum! Et hucusque non comparet.
<br>Si tuleritis et istum a facie mea, et aliquid ei in via contigerit, deducetis canos meos cum maerore ad inferos".
<br>Igitur, si intravero ad servum tuum patrem meum, et puer defuerit ­ cum anima illius ex huius anima pendeat ­
<br>videritque eum non esse nobiscum, morietur; et deducent famuli tui canos eius cum dolore ad inferos.
<br>Servus tuus pro puero patri meo spopondit: Nisi reduxero eum, peccati reus ero in patrem meum omni tempore.
<br>Manebo itaque servus tuus pro puero in ministerio domini mei, et puer ascendat cum fratribus suis.
<br>Non enim possum redire ad patrem meum, absente puero, ne calamitatis, quae oppressura est patrem meum, testis assistam ”.

<br>Non se poterat ultra cohibere Ioseph omnibus coram astantibus, unde clamavit: “ Egredimini, cuncti, foras! ”. Et nemo aderat cum eo, quando manifestavit se fratribus suis.
<br>Elevavitque vocem cum fletu, quam audierunt Aegyptii omnisque domus pharaonis.
<br>Et dixit Ioseph fratribus suis: “ Ego sum Ioseph! Adhuc pater meus vivit? ”. Nec poterant respondere fratres nimio terrore perterriti.
<br>Ad quos ille clementer: “ Accedite, inquit, ad me ”. Et cum accessissent prope: “ Ego sum, ait, Ioseph frater vester, quem vendidistis in Aegyptum.
<br>Nolite contristari, neque vobis durum esse videatur quod vendidistis me in his regionibus. Pro salute enim vestra misit me Deus ante vos in Aegyptum.
<br>Biennium est enim quod coepit fames esse in terra, et adhuc quinque anni restant, quibus nec arari poterit nec meti.
<br>Praemisitque me Deus, ut reservemini super terram, et servetur vita vestra in salvationem magnam.
<br>Non vestro consilio, sed Dei voluntate huc missus sum, qui fecit me quasi patrem pharaonis et dominum universae domus eius ac principem in omni terra Aegypti.
<br>Festinate et ascendite ad patrem meum et dicetis ei: "Haec mandat filius tuus Ioseph: Deus fecit me dominum universae terrae Aegypti; descende ad me, ne moreris.
<br>Et habitabis in terra Gessen; erisque iuxta me tu et filii tui et filii filiorum tuorum, oves tuae et armenta tua et universa, quae possides.
<br>Ibique te pascam ­ adhuc enim quinque anni residui sunt famis ­ ne et tu pereas et domus tua et omnia, quae possides".
<br>En oculi vestri et oculi fratris mei Beniamin vident quia os meum est, quod loquitur ad vos.
<br>Nuntiate patri meo universam gloriam meam in Aegypto et cuncta, quae vidistis. Festinate et adducite eum ad me ”.
<br>Cumque amplexatus recidisset in collum Beniamin fratris sui, flevit, illo quoque similiter flente, super collum eius.
<br>Osculatusque est Ioseph omnes fratres suos et ploravit super singulos. Post quae ausi sunt loqui ad eum.
<br>Auditumque est et celebri sermone vulgatum in aula regis: “ Venerunt fratres Ioseph! ”. Et gavisus est pharao atque omnis familia eius.
<br>Dixitque ad Ioseph, ut imperaret fratribus suis dicens: “ Onerantes iumenta ite in terram Chanaan
<br>et tollite inde patrem vestrum et cognationem et venite ad me; et ego dabo vobis omnia bona Aegypti, ut comedatis medullam terrae.
<br>Praecipe etiam: tollite plaustra de terra Aegypti ad subvectionem parvulorum vestrorum ac coniugum et tollite patrem vestrum et properate quantocius venientes.
<br>Nec doleatis super supellectilem vestram, quia omnes opes Aegypti vestrae erunt ”.
<br>Feceruntque filii Israel, ut eis mandatum fuerat. Quibus dedit Ioseph plaustra secundum pharaonis imperium et cibaria in itinere.
<br>Singulis quoque proferri iussit vestimentum mutatorium; Beniamin vero dedit trecentos argenteos cum quinque
<br>vestimentis mutatoriis. Patri suo misit similiter asinos decem, qui subveherent ex omnibus divitiis Aegypti, et totidem asinas triticum et panem et cibum pro itinere portantes.
<br>Dimisit ergo fratres suos et proficiscentibus ait: “ Ne irascamini in via! ”.
<br>Qui ascendentes ex Aegypto venerunt in terram Chanaan ad patrem suum Iacob
<br>et nuntiaverunt ei dicentes: “ Ioseph vivit et ipse dominatur in omni terra Aegypti! ”. At cor eius frigidum mansit; non enim credebat eis.
<br>Tunc referebant omnia verba Ioseph, quae dixerat eis. Cumque vidisset plaustra et universa, quae miserat ad adducendum eum, revixit spiritus eius,
<br>et ait: “ Sufficit mihi, si adhuc Ioseph filius meus vivit. Vadam et videbo illum, antequam moriar ”.

<br>Profectusque Israel cum omnibus, quae habebat, venit Bersabee et, mactatis ibi victimis Deo patris sui Isaac,
<br>audivit eum per visionem noctis vocantem se: “ Iacob, Iacob! ”. Cui respondit: “ Ecce adsum! ”.
<br>Ait illi: “ Ego sum Deus, Deus patris tui. Noli timere descendere in Aegyptum, quia in gentem magnam faciam te ibi.
<br>Ego descendam tecum illuc et ego inde adducam te revertentem; Ioseph quoque ponet manus suas super oculos tuos ”.
<br>Surrexit igitur Iacob a Bersabee, tuleruntque eum filii cum parvulis et uxoribus suis in plaustris, quae miserat pharao ad portandum senem,
<br>sumpserunt quoque omnia, quae possederant in terra Chanaan; veneruntque in Aegyptum Iacob et omne semen eius,
<br>filii eius et nepotes, filiae et cuncta simul progenies.
<br>Haec sunt autem nomina filiorum Israel, qui ingressi sunt in Aegyptum, ipse cum liberis suis.<br>
Primogenitus Ruben.
<br>Filii Ruben: Henoch et Phallu et Hesron et Charmi.
<br>Filii Simeon: Iamuel et Iamin et Ahod et Iachin et Sohar et Saul filius Chananitidis.
<br>Filii Levi: Gerson et Caath et Merari.
<br>Filii Iudae: Her et Onan et Sela et Phares et Zara. Mortui sunt autem Her et Onan in terra Chanaan. Natique sunt filii Phares: Esrom et Hamul.
<br>Filii Issachar: Thola et Phua et Iasub et Semron.
<br>Filii Zabulon: Sared et Elon et Iahelel.
<br>Hi filii Liae, quos genuit in Paddanaram, cum Dina filia sua. Omnes animae filiorum eius et filiarum triginta tres.
<br>Filii Gad: Sephon et Haggi, Suni et Esebon, Heri et Arodi et Areli.
<br>Filii Aser: Iemna et lesua et Isui et Beria, Sara quoque soror eorum. Filii Beria: Heber et Melchiel.
<br>Hi filii Zelphae, quam dedit Laban Liae filiae suae; et hos genuit Iacob: sedecim animas.
<br>Filii Rachel uxoris Iacob: Ioseph et Beniamin.
<br>Natique sunt Ioseph filii in terra Aegypti, quos genuit ei Aseneth filia Putiphare sacerdotis Heliopoleos: Manasses et Ephraim.
<br>Filii Beniamin: Bela et Bochor et Asbel, Gera et Naaman et Echi et Ros, Mophim et Huphim et Ared.
<br>Hi filii Rachel, quos genuit Iacob: omnes animae quattuordecim.
<br>Filii Dan: Husim.
<br>Filii Nephthali: Iasiel et Guni et Ieser et Sellem.
<br>Hi filii Bilhae, quam dedit Laban Racheli filiae suae; et hos genuit Iacob: omnes animae septem.
<br>Cunctae animae, quae ingressae sunt cum Iacob in Aegyptum et egressae de femore illius, absque uxoribus filiorum eius, sexaginta sex.
<br>Filii autem Ioseph, qui nati sunt ei in terra Aegypti, animae duae. Omnes animae domus Iacob, quae ingressae sunt in Aegyptum, fuere septuaginta.
<br>Misit autem Iudam ante se ad Ioseph, ut nuntiaret et occurreret in Gessen.
<br>Et venerunt in terram Gessen. Iunctoque Ioseph curru suo, ascendit obviam patri suo in Gessen; vidensque eum irruit super collum eius et inter amplexus diu flevit.
<br>Dixitque Israel ad Ioseph: “ Iam laetus moriar, quia vidi faciem tuam et superstitem te relinquo ”.
<br>Et ille locutus est ad fratres suos et ad omnem domum patris sui: “ Ascendam et nuntiabo pharaoni dicamque ei: Fratres mei et domus patris mei, qui erant in terra Chanaan, venerunt ad me.
<br>Et sunt viri pastores ovium curamque habent alendorum gregum; pecora sua et armenta et omnia, quae habere potuerunt, adduxerunt secum.
<br>Cumque vocaverit vos et dixerit: "Quod est opus vestrum?".
<br>Respondebitis: "Viri pastores sumus servi tui ab infantia nostra usque in praesens et nos et patres nostri". Haec autem dicetis, ut habitare possitis in terra Gessen, quia detestantur Aegyptii omnes pastores ovium ”.

<br>Ingressus ergo Ioseph nuntiavit pharaoni dicens: “ Pater meus et fratres, oves eorum et armenta et cuncta, quae possident, venerunt de terra Chanaan; et ecce consistunt in terra Gessen ”.
<br>Ex omnibus fratribus suis quinque viros statuit coram rege,
<br>quos ille interrogavit: “ Quid habetis operis? ”. Responderunt: “ Pastores ovium sumus servi tui et nos et patres nostri ”.
<br>Dixeruntque ad pharaonem: “ Ad peregrinandum in terra venimus, quoniam non est herba gregibus servorum tuorum, ingravescente fame, in terra Chanaan petimusque, ut esse nos iubeas servos tuos in terra Gessen ”.
<br>Dixit itaque rex ad Ioseph: “ Pater tuus et fratres tui venerunt ad te.
<br>Terra Aegypti in conspectu tuo est; in optimo loco fac eos habitare et trade eis terram Gessen. Quod si nosti in eis esse viros industrios, constitue illos magistros pecorum meorum ”.
<br>Post haec introduxit Ioseph patrem suum ad regem et statuit eum coram eo, qui benedicens illi
<br>et interrogatus ab eo: “ Quot sunt dies annorum vitae tuae? ”,
<br>respondit: “ Dies peregrinationis meae centum triginta annorum sunt, parvi et mali; et non pervenerunt usque ad dies patrum meorum, quibus peregrinati sunt ”.
<br>Et benedicto rege, egressus est foras.
<br>Ioseph vero patri et fratribus suis dedit possessionem in Aegypto in optimo terrae loco, in terra Ramesses, ut praeceperat pharao;
<br>et alebat eos omnemque domum patris sui praebens cibaria singulis.
<br>In tota terra panis deerat, et oppresserat fames terram valde, defecitque terra Aegypti et terra Chanaan prae fame.
<br>E quibus omnem pecuniam congregavit pro venditione frumenti et intulit eam in aerarium regis.
<br>Cumque defecisset emptoribus pretium, venit cuncta Aegyptus ad Ioseph dicens: “ Da nobis panes! Quare morimur coram te, deficiente pecunia? ”.
<br>Quibus ille respondit: “ Adducite pecora vestra, et dabo vobis pro eis cibos, si pretium non habetis ”.
<br>Quae cum adduxissent, dedit eis alimenta pro equis et ovibus et bobus et asinis; sustentavitque eos illo anno pro commutatione pecorum.
<br>Venerunt quoque anno secundo et dixerunt ei: “ Non celamus dominum nostrum quod, deficiente pecunia, pecora transierunt ad dominum nostrum; nec clam te est quod absque corporibus et terra nihil habeamus.
<br>Cur ergo moriemur, te vidente, et nos et terra nostra? Eme nos et terram nostram in servitutem regiam et praebe semina, ne, pereunte cultore, redigatur terra in solitudinem ”.
<br>Emit igitur Ioseph omnem terram Aegypti, vendentibus singulis possessiones suas prae magnitudine famis. Subiecitque eam pharaoni
<br>et cunctos populos eius redegit ei in servitutem, a novissimis terminis Aegypti usque ad extremos fines eius.
<br>Terram autem sacerdotum non emit, qui cibariis a rege statutis fruebantur, et idcirco non sunt compulsi vendere possessiones suas.
<br>Dixit ergo Ioseph ad populos: “ En, ut cernitis, et vos et terram vestram pharao possidet; accipite semina et serite agros,
<br>ut fruges habere possitis. Quintam partem regi dabitis; quattuor reliquas permitto vobis in sementem et in cibum familiis et liberis vestris ”.
<br>Qui responderunt: “ Tu salvasti nos! Respiciat nos tantum dominus noster, et laeti serviemus regi ”.
<br>Ex eo tempore usque in praesentem diem in universa terra Aegypti regibus quinta pars solvitur; et factum est a Ioseph in legem absque terra sacerdotali, quae libera ab hac condicione est.
<br>Habitavit ergo Israel in Aegypto, id est in terra Gessen, et possedit eam; auctusque est et multiplicatus nimis.
<br>Et vixit Iacob in terra Aegypti decem et septem annis; factique sunt omnes dies vitae illius centum quadraginta septem annorum.
<br>Cumque appropinquare cerneret diem mortis suae, vocavit filium suum Ioseph et dixit ad eum: “ Si inveni gratiam in conspectu tuo, pone manum tuam sub femore meo et facies mihi misericordiam et veritatem, ut non sepelias me in Aegypto,
<br>sed dormiam cum patribus meis, et auferas me de terra hac condasque in sepulcro maiorum meorum ”. Cui respondit Ioseph: “ Ego faciam, quod iussisti ”.
<br>Et ille: “ Iura ergo, inquit, mihi! ”. Quo iurante, adoravit Israel conversus ad lectuli caput.

<br>His ita transactis, nuntiatum est Ioseph quod aegrotaret pater suus. Et assumpsit secum duos filios Manasse et Ephraim.
<br>Dictumque est seni: “ Ecce filius tuus Ioseph venit ad te ”. Qui confortatus sedit in lectulo
<br>et ingresso ad se ait: “ Deus omnipotens apparuit mihi in Luza, quae est in terra Chanaan, benedixitque mihi
<br>et ait: "Ego te augebo et multiplicabo et faciam te in multitudinem populorum; daboque tibi terram hanc et semini tuo post te in possessionem sempiternam".
<br>Duo ergo filii tui, qui nati sunt tibi in terra Aegypti, antequam huc venirem ad te, mei erunt: Ephraim et Manasses sicut Ruben et Simeon reputabuntur mihi.
<br>Reliquos autem, quos genueris post eos, tui erunt et nomine fratrum suorum vocabuntur in possessionibus suis.
<br>Mihi enim, quando veniebam de Paddanaram, mortua est Rachel mater tua in terra Chanaan in ipso itinere, cum adhuc esset spatium aliquod usque ad Ephratham, et sepelivi eam iuxta viam Ephrathae, quae alio nomine appellatur Bethlehem ”.
<br>Videns autem filios eius dixit ad eum: “ Qui sunt isti? ”.
<br>Respondit: “ Filii mei sunt, quos donavit mihi Deus in hoc loco ”. “ Adduc, inquit, eos ad me, ut benedicam illis! ”.
<br>Oculi enim Israel caligabant prae nimia senectute, et clare videre non poterat. Applicitosque ad se deosculatus et circumplexus eos
<br>dixit ad filium suum: “ Non sum fraudatus aspectu tuo; insuper ostendit mihi Deus semen tuum ”.
<br>Cumque tulisset eos Ioseph de gremio patris, adoravit pronus in terram.
<br>Et posuit Ephraim ad dexteram suam, id est ad sinistram Israel, Manassen vero in sinistra sua, ad dexteram scilicet patris; applicuitque ambos ad eum.
<br>Qui extendens manum dexteram, posuit super caput Ephraim minoris fratris, sinistram autem super caput Manasse, qui maior natu erat, commutans manus.
<br>Benedixitque Iacob Ioseph et ait:<br>
“ Deus, in cuius conspectu ambulaverunt<br>
patres mei Abraham et Isaac,<br>
Deus, qui pascit me ab adulescentia mea<br>
usque in praesentem diem,
<br>Angelus, qui eruit me de cunctis malis,<br>
benedicat pueris istis!<br>
Et invocetur super eos nomen meum,<br>
nomina quoque patrum meorum Abraham et Isaac,<br>
et crescant in multitudinem<br>
super terram! ”.
<br>Videns autem Ioseph quod posuisset pater suus dexteram manum super caput Ephraim, graviter accepit et apprehensam manum patris levare conatus est de capite Ephraim et transferre super caput Manasse.
<br>Dixitque ad patrem: “ Non ita convenit, pater, quia hic est primogenitus; pone dexteram tuam super caput eius! ”.
<br>Qui renuens ait: “ Scio, fili mi, scio; et iste quidem erit in populos et multiplicabitur, sed frater eius minor maior erit illo, et semen illius crescet in plenitudinem gentium ”.
<br>Benedixitque eis in die illo dicens:<br>
“ In te benedicet Israel atque dicet: "Faciat te Deus sicut Ephraim et sicut Manasse!" ”.<br>
Constituitque Ephraim ante Manassen.
<br>Et ait ad Ioseph filium suum: “ En ego morior, et erit Deus vobiscum reducetque vos ad terram patrum vestrorum.
<br>Do tibi partem unam extra fratres tuos, quam tuli de manu Amorraei in gladio et arcu meo ”.

<br>Omnes hi in tribubus Israel duodecim. Haec locutus est eis pater suus benedixitque singulis benedictionibus propriis.
<br>Et praecepit eis dicens: “ Ego congregor ad populum meum; sepelite me cum patribus meis in spelunca Machpela, quae est in agro Ephron Hetthaei
<br>contra Mambre in terra Chanaan, quam emit Abraham cum agro ab Ephron Hetthaeo in possessionem sepulcri;

<br>Finitisque mandatis, quibus filios instruebat, collegit pedes suos super lectulum et obiit; appositusque est ad populum suum.

<br>Ioseph ruit super faciem patris flens et deosculans eum.
<br>Praecepitque servis suis medicis, ut aromatibus condirent patrem.
<br>Quibus iussa explentibus, transierunt quadraginta dies; iste quippe mos erat cadaverum conditorum. Flevitque eum Aegyptus septuaginta diebus.
<br>Et, expleto planctus tempore, locutus est Ioseph ad familiam pharaonis: “ Si inveni gratiam in conspectu vestro, loquimini in auribus pharaonis,
<br>eo quod pater meus adiuraverit me dicens: "En morior; in sepulcro meo, quod fodi mihi in terra Chanaan, sepelies me"; ascendam nunc et sepeliam patrem meum ac revertar ”.
<br>Dixitque ei pharao: “ Ascende et sepeli patrem tuum, sicut adiuratus es ”.
<br>Quo ascendente, ierunt cum eo omnes servi pharaonis, senes domus eius cunctique maiores natu terrae Aegypti,
<br>domus Ioseph cum fratribus suis, absque parvulis et gregibus atque armentis, quae dereliquerant in terra Gessen.
<br>Habuit quoque in comitatu currus et equites; et facta est turba non modica.
<br>Veneruntque ad Gorenatad (id est Aream rhamni), quae sita est trans Iordanem; ubi celebrantes exsequias planctu magno atque vehementi impleverunt septem dies.
<br>Quod cum vidissent habitatores terrae Chanaan, dixerunt: “ Planctus magnus est iste Aegyptiis ”; et idcirco vocatum est nomen loci illius Abelmesraim (id est Planctus Aegypti).
<br>Fecerunt ergo filii Iacob, sicut praeceperat eis;
<br>et portantes eum in terram Chanaan sepelierunt eum in spelunca Machpela, quam emerat Abraham cum agro in possessionem sepulcri ab Ephron Hetthaeo contra faciem Mambre.
<br>Reversusque est Ioseph in Aegyptum cum fratribus suis et omni comitatu, sepulto patre.
<br>Quo mortuo, timentes fratres eius et mutuo colloquentes: “ Ne forte memor sit iniuriae, quam passus est, et reddat nobis omne malum, quod fecimus ”,
<br>mandaverunt ei dicentes: “ Pater tuus praecepit nobis, antequam moreretur,
<br>ut haec tibi verbis illius diceremus: "Obsecro, ut obliviscaris sceleris fratrum tuorum et peccati atque malitiae, quam exercuerunt in te". Nos quoque oramus, ut servis Dei patris tui dimittas iniquitatem hanc ”. Quibus auditis, flevit Ioseph.
<br>Veneruntque ad eum fratres sui et proni coram eo dixerunt: “ Servi tui sumus ”.
<br>Quibus ille respondit: “ Nolite timere. Num Dei possumus resistere voluntati?
<br>Vos cogitastis de me malum; sed Deus vertit illud in bonum, ut exaltaret me, sicut in praesentiarum cernitis, et salvos faceret multos populos.
<br>Nolite timere: ego pascam vos et parvulos vestros ”. Consolatusque est eos et blande ac leniter est locutus.
<br>Et habitavit in Aegypto cum omni domo patris sui; vixitque centum decem annis
<br>et vidit Ephraim filios usque ad tertiam generationem; filii quoque Machir filii Manasse nati sunt in genibus Ioseph.
<br>Quibus transactis, locutus est fratribus suis: “ Post mortem meam Deus visitabit vos et ascendere vos faciet de terra ista ad terram, quam iuravit Abraham, Isaac et Iacob ”.
<br>Cumque adiurasset eos atque dixisset: “ Deus visitabit vos; asportate ossa mea vobiscum de loco isto ”,
<br>mortuus est, expletis centum decem vitae suae annis. Et conditus aromatibus repositus est in loculo in Aegypto.

 <br>The Vulgate (/ˈvʌlɡeɪt,  -ɡət/; also called  Biblia Vulgata  (Bible in common tongue),  Latin: [ˈbɪbli.a wʊlˈɡaːta]), sometimes referred to as the Latin Vulgate, is a late-4th-century Latin translation of the Bible.<br>The Vulgate is largely the work of Jerome who, in 382, had been commissioned by Pope Damasus I to revise the Vetus Latina Gospels used by the Roman Church. Later, on his own initiative, Jerome extended this work of revision and translation to include most of the books of the Bible. The Vulgate became progressively adopted as the Bible text within the Western Church. Over succeeding centuries, it eventually eclipsed the  Vetus Latina. By the 13th century it had taken over from the former version the designation  versio vulgata (the "version commonly used") or vulgata for short. The Vulgate also contains some Vetus Latina translations that Jerome did not work on.<br>The Vulgate was to become the Catholic Church's officially promulgated Latin version of the Bible as the Sixtine Vulgate (1590), then as the Clementine Vulgate (1592), and then as the  <a class="internal-link" data-href="Vulgateindex.md" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Sacred Scripture/Vulgate/Vulgateindex.html" target="_self" rel="noopener"><em></em></a>Nova Vulgata  (1979). The Vulgate is still currently used in the Latin Church. The Catholic Church affirmed the Vulgate as its official Latin Bible at the Council of Trent (1545–1563), though there was no authoritative edition at that time. The Clementine edition of the Vulgate became the standard Bible text of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and remained so until 1979 when the <a class="internal-link" data-href="Vulgateindex.md" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Sacred Scripture/Vulgate/Vulgateindex.html" target="_self" rel="noopener"><em></em></a>Nova Vulgata was promulgated.]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Sacred Scripture/Vulgate/Vulgate.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Sacred Scripture/Vulgate/Vulgate.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 02:15:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Nova Vulgata]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>The Bible (from  Koine Greek  τὰ βιβλία,  tà biblía, 'the books') is a collection of  religious texts or scriptures that are held to be sacred in Christianity,  Judaism, Samaritanism, Islam, and many other religions. The Bible is an anthology—a compilation of texts of a variety of forms—originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. These texts include instructions, stories, poetry, and prophecies, among other genres. The collection of materials that are accepted as part of the Bible by a particular religious tradition or community is called a biblical canon. Believers in the Bible generally consider it to be a product of divine inspiration, but the way they understand what that means and interpret the text  can vary.<br>The religious texts were compiled by different religious communities into various official collections. The earliest contained the first five books of the Bible. It is called the Torah in Hebrew and the Pentateuch (meaning  five books) in Greek; the second oldest part was a collection of narrative histories and prophecies (the Nevi'im); the third collection (the Ketuvim) contains psalms, proverbs, and narrative histories. "Tanakh" is an alternate term for the Hebrew Bible composed of the first letters of those three parts of the Hebrew scriptures: the Torah ("Teaching"), the Nevi'im ("Prophets"), and the Ketuvim ("Writings"). The Masoretic Text is the medieval version of the Tanakh, in Hebrew and Aramaic, that is considered the authoritative text of the Hebrew Bible by modern Rabbinic Judaism. The Septuagint is a Koine Greek translation of the Tanakh from the third and second centuries BC; it largely overlaps with the Hebrew Bible.<br>Christianity began as an outgrowth of Judaism, using the Septuagint as the basis of the Old Testament. The early <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> continued the Jewish tradition of writing and incorporating what it saw as inspired, authoritative religious books. The gospels, Pauline epistles and other texts  quickly coalesced into the New Testament.<br>With estimated total sales of over five billion copies, the Bible is the best-selling publication of all time. It has had a profound influence both on Western culture and history and on cultures around the globe. The study of it through biblical criticism has indirectly impacted culture and history as well. The Bible is currently translated or being translated into about half of the world's languages.<br><br>They do bad things so they can make money.

 <br>The Supernatural Order is the ensemble of effects exceeding the powers of the created universe and gratuitously produced by God for the purpose of raising the rational creature above its native sphere to a God-like life and destiny. The meaning of the phrase fluctuates with that of its antithesis, the natural order. Those who conceive the latter as the world of material beings to the exclusion of immaterial entities, or as the necessary mechanism of cause and effect to the exclusion of the free agency of the will, or again as the inherent forces of the universe to the exclusion of the extrinsic concurrence of God, quite consistently call supernatural all spiritual facts or voluntary determinations or Divine operations. There is no objection to that way of speaking provided the assertion of the supernatural so understood be not made, by a fallacious transference of meaning, to screen the negation of the supernatural as defined above. Catholic theologians sometimes call supernatural the miraculous way in which certain effects, in themselves natural, are produced, or certain endowments (like man's immunity from death, suffering, passion, and ignorance) that bring the lower class up to the higher though always within the limits of the created, but they are careful in qualifying the former as accidentally supernatural (supernaturale per accidens) and the latter as relatively supernatural (prœternaturale). For a concept of the substantially and absolutely supernatural, they start from a comprehensive view of the natural order taken, in its amplest acceptation, for the aggregate of all created entities and powers, including the highest natural endowments of which the rational creature is capable, and even such Divine operations as are demanded by the effective carrying out of the cosmic order. The supernatural order is then more than a miraculous way of producing natural effects, or a notion of relative superiority within the created world, or the necessary concurrence of God in the universe; it is an effect or series of effects substantially and absolutely above all nature and, as such, calls for an exceptional intervention and gratuitous bestowal of God and rises in a manner to the Divine order, the only one that transcends the whole created world. Although some theologians do not consider impossible the elevation of the irrational creature to the Divine order, v. g., by way of personal union, nevertheless it stands to reason that such an exalted privilege should be reserved for the rational creature capable of knowledge and love. It is obvious also that this uplifting of the rational creature to the supernatural order cannot be by way of absorption of the created into the Divine or of fusion of both into a sort of monistic identity, but only by way of union or participation, the two terms remaining perfectly distinct.<br>Not being an a priori conception but a positive fact, the supernatural order can only be known through Divine revelation properly supported by such Divine evidences as miracle, prophecy, etc. Revelation and its evidences are called extrinsic and auxiliary supernatural, the elevation itself retaining the name of intrinsic or, according to some, theological supernatural. There are three principal instances of such elevation:<br>
<br>The hypostatic union or the assumption of the Sacred Humanity of Christ into the personal dignity of the Son of God;
<br>The calling of the faithful angels to the beatific vision whereby they see always the face of the Father who is in heaven (Matthew 18:10), and
<br>The elevation of man to the state of grace here and glory hereafter.
<br>The hypostatic union and the angelic supernatural are both closely connected with our own elevation. From St. John (i, 12-14) we know that the hypostatic union is the ideal and instrument of it, and St. Paul declares that the angels are "all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of salvation" (Hebrews 1:14). Leaving for separate treatment the auxiliary supernatural (see REVELATION; MIRACLE; PROPHECY), the hypostatic union (see INCARNATION), and the angels' elevation (see ANGELS), this article deals with the supernatural order in man both in its history and analysis.<br>Briefly, the history is this: From the beginning, man was raised, far above the claims of his nature, to a life which made him, even here below, the adopted child of God, and to a destiny which entitled him to the beatific vision and love of God in heaven. To these strictly supernatural gifts by which man was truly made partaker of the Divine nature (2 Peter 1:4) were added preternatural endowments, that is immunity from ignorance, passion, suffering and death, which left him "little lower than the angels" (Psalm 8:6; Hebrews 2:7). Through their own fault, our first parents forfeited for themselves and their race both the God-like life and destiny and the angel-like endowments. In His mercy God promised a Redeemer who, heralded by ages of prophecy, came in the fulness of time in the person of <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>, the incarnate Son of God. By His Incarnation, labours, passion, and death, <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a> restored mankind to its former Divine sonship and heavenly inheritance, if not to its quasi-angelic prerogatives, the virtue of Redemption being applied to us through the joint ministrations of the inner Spirit, and of the visible Church, in the form of actual helps, habitual sanctity, and the power of meriting Heaven.<br>An analysis of the supernatural order, barely inaugurated by the Fathers, but brought to a point of great perfection by the Schoolmen and post-Tridentine theologians, discloses the various elements that make up order, that is an end, means, and laws. The end is man's destination to see God face to face and to love Him correspondingly. If, as will be shown, the intuitive vision of God is our true destiny and moreover transcends our highest natural powers, then we must be given means capable of attaining that end, that is supernatural. Those means can be no other than our own actions, but invested with a higher power that makes them meritorious of Heaven. Grace, both actual and habitual, is the source of that meriting power: while habitual grace, with its train of infused virtues or faculties raises our mode of being and operating to a sphere which is God's own, actual grace spurs us on to justification and, once we stand justified, sets in motion our supernatural powers causing them to yield good and meritorious works. In the supernatural order, as in all others, there are also specific laws. The work of man's sanctification depends in a manner on the general laws of the universe and most certainly upon the carrying out of all the moral precepts written in our hearts. Besides these laws which Christ came not to abolish, there are positive or freely established enactments ranging all the way from the Divinely appointed conditions of salvation to the revealed obligations and even the rules governing our growth in holiness. Glory and grace, being the central features of the supernatural order, special reference will be made to them both in the exposition of errors and the establishment of the Catholic doctrine.<br><br>The theories denying or belittling the supernatural order may be classified from the standpoint of both their historical appearance and logical sequence, into three groups according as they view the supernatural;<br>
<br>In our present de facto condition,
<br>In the original status of man,
<br>In its possibility and evidences.
<br>To the first group belong Pelagianism and Semipelagianism. Influenced, no doubt, by the Stoic ideal and their own ascetic performances, the Pelagians of the fifth century so magnified the capacity of human nature as to pronounce natural to it both the beatific vision and the human acts by which it is merited. They were condemned by the Councils of Mileve and Carthage, 418. Less daring, the Semipelagians, censured by the Council of Orange (529), subtracted from the supernatural only certain phases of man's life as the beginning of faith and final perseverance. To this group belong also, in a manner, the false mystics of the fourteenth century, the Beghards condemned by the Council of Vienne (1312), for claiming that the rational creature possesses beatitude in itself without the help of the lumen gloriœ and Eckhart, whose identification of the Creator and the creature in the act of contemplation was censured by John XXII in 1329.<br>To the second group belong the early Reformers and the Jansenist School, though in different degrees. Misinterpreting the still imperfect terminology of the Fathers who called natural, in the sense of original, the elevation of our first parents, the early Reformers held that, according to Patristic teaching and contrarily to the Schoolmen, that elevation was not supernatural. Their error, rejected by the Council of Trent (Sess. V, decretum de peccato originali, can. 1), was taken up again, but in a more refined form, by Baius who, indeed, designated as supernatural man's original condition but nullified the meaning of the word by stating that our first parent's elevation was demanded by and due to the normal condition of humanity. In spite of his condemnation by Pius V (Denzinger, 9th ed., nn. 901, 903, 906, 922) he was followed by the Jansenist Quesnel and the pseudo-Synod of Pistoia, the former censured by Clement XI (Denzinger, nn. 1249, 1250) and the latter by Pius VI (Denzinger, nn. 1379, 1380, 1383). A confusion between the moral and the supernatural order, frequently found in the Baianist and Jansenist writings, was reproduced more or less consciously by some German theologians like Stattler, Hermes, Gunther, Hirsh, Kuhn, etc., who admitted the supernatural character of the other gifts but contended that the adoption to eternal life and the partaking of the Divine nature, being a moral necessity, could not be supernatural. That revival of an old error found a strong and successful opponent in Kleutgen in the second volume of his theology on the supernatural.<br>To the third group belongs the Rationalist School from Socinus to the present Modernists. While the foregoing errors proceeded less from a direct denial than from a confusion of the supernatural with the natural order, the Rationalist error rejects it in its entirety, on the plea of philosophical impossibility or critical non-existence. The Syllabus of Pius IX and the Vatican Constitution "De fide catholica" (Denzinger, n. 1655) checked for a while that radical Naturalism which, however, has reappeared lately in a still more virulent form with Modernism. While there is nothing common between Rosmini and the present Modernists, he may, all unwittingly, have paved the way for them in the following vaguely Subjectivist proposition: "The supernatural order consists in the manifestation of Being in the plenitude of its reality, and the effect of that manifestation is a God-like sentiment, inchoate in this life through the light of faith and grace, consummate in the next through the light of glory" (36th Rosminian proposition condemned by the Holy Office, 14 Dec., 1887). Preserving the dogmatic formulæ while voiding them of their contents, the Modernists constantly speak of the supernatural, but they understand thereby the advanced stages of an evolutive process of the religious sentiment. There is no room in their system for the objective and revealed supernatural: their Agnosticism declares it unknowable, their Immanentism derives it from our own vitality, their symbolism explains it in term of subjective experience and their criticism declares non-authentic the documents used to prove it. "There is no question now," says Pius X, in his Encyclical "Pascendi" of 8 Sept., 1907, "of the old error by which a sort of right to the supernatural was claimed for human nature. We have gone far beyond that. We have reached the point where it is affirmed that our most holy religion, in the man Christ as in us, emanated from nature spontaneously and entirely. Than this, there is surely nothing more destructive of the whole supernatural order."<br><br>From the above documents, it may be summarized in three points: (1) The fact of man's elevation to grace and glory as against the Pelagian error; (2) the supernatural character of that elevation as against the Protestant and Jansenist theory; and (3) as against Rationalism, its possibility and the validity of its credentials.<br><br>The fact of man's elevation, probably alluded to in the likeness of God imprinted in Adam (Genesis 1:26), in the tree of life from which he was barred in consequence of his sin (Genesis 3:22), and in the intimate union of man with God, as described in the Sapiential and Prophetic books, has its full expression in the discourses of <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a> (John 6 and 14-17), in the prologue of the Fourth Gospel compared with John 2 and 3, and in the introduction to several Epistles like 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and 1 Peter. The direct and face-to-face vision of God is our future destiny (1 Corinthians 13:12; 1 John 3:2). In this world we are not in name only but in very fact the sons of God (1 John 3:1), being born anew (1 John 3:7) and having the charity of God infused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us (Romans 5:5). The emphasis laid by the early Fathers on man's deification has been shown elsewhere (see ADOPTION). In view of all this it is not true that the Fathers had not even a name to designate the supernatural, as is often asserted by modern critics. De Broglie (Le surnaturel, p. 45) shows that there were at least four different phrases to express the supernatural gifts: hyper physin (above nature), adscititia (superadded), exothen tes ousias (foreign to the essence), charis, charismata (gratuitous).<br><br>The gratuitous or supernatural character of the beatific vision was placed in bold relief by St. Paul (1 Timothy 6:15) and St. John (1:18 and 6:46). St. Irenæus merely paraphrases their teaching in the famous sentence: "Homo a se non videt Deum; ille autem volens videtur hominibus quibus vult, quando vult, quemadmodum vult; potens est enim in omnibus Deus" (Contra hæres., v, 20). Neither can one read such passages as Ephesians 1:16-19 and 3:14-21; Colossians 1:10 sq.; 2 Peter 1:4; etc., without realizing that the supernatural character of the intuitive vision applies likewise to present charity "which surpasses all knowledge". The transcendence of the supernatural order, not only above our present de facto condition, but also above our native constitution viewed philosophically in the elements and properties and exigencies of human nature, is not emphasized in early Christian literature, which deals not with abstractions. St. Paul, however, describing the rôle of the Redeemer which is to renovate, repair, and restore, comes very near the point by hinting that our present, clearly supernatural elevation is but a return to the no less supernatural condition of the "old Adam"; and while the point is not fully discussed by the Fathers before the Pelagian controversies concerning original sin, yet some passing remarks by St. Irenæus (Contra hæres., III, xviii, 1, 2) and St. John Chrysostom (X Homily on St. John, 2) show that there is no chasm between the early Fathers, St. Augustine, who presented a bold, if not finished, delineation of the supernatural as such, and the Schoolmen and post-Tridentine theologians (as Soto, "De natura et gratia"; Ripalda, "De ente supernaturali"; Francisco Suárez, "De variis statibus") who carefully distinguished the various states of human nature. Ripalda's opinion to the effect that the beatific vision which is de facto supernatural to the whole actual creation might become natural to some possible higher creature, has never been formally condemned by the Church; it is however unanimously rejected by theologians, as it seems less conformable to Scriptural sayings and tends to destroy the absolute transcendence of the supernatural order.<br><br>The philosophical possibility and the critical ascertainment of the supernatural order are the central point of Christian apologetics. Against the prejudicial views of the Rationalists who pronounce it inexistent, or unnecessary, or mischievous, or even impossible, Christian apologists urge, and to good purpose, the critical value of the records on which it rests, its quasi-necessity for the correct conduct of life, the profits it brings to its recipients, and the utter want of foundation of its so-called antinomies. Having thus cleared the ground, they proceed to collect and interpret and organize the various data of Revelation, the result being a harmonious and truly grandiose system of overlife. From the commonly received axiom that "grace does not destroy but only perfects nature" they establish between the two orders a parallelism that is not mutual confusion or reciprocal exclusion, but distinction and subordination. The Schoolmen spoke freely of nature's possibilities (potentia obedientialis) and even conations (appetitus naturalis) towards the supernatural. To those traditional methods and views some Christian writers have, of late, endeavoured to add and even substitute another theory which, they claim, will bring the supernatural home to the modern mind and give it unquestionable credentials. The novel theory consists in making nature postulate the supernatural. Whatever be the legitimity of the purpose, the method is ambiguous and full of pitfalls. Between the Schoolmen's potentia obedientialis and appetitus moralis and the Modernist tenet according to which the supernatural "emanates from nature spontaneously and entirely" there is space and distance; at the same time, the Catholic apologist who would attempt to fill some of the space and cover some of the distance should keep in mind the admonition of Pius X to those "Catholics who, while rejecting immanence as a doctrine, employ it as a method of apologetics, and who do this so imprudently that they seem to admit that there is in human nature a true and rigorous necessity with regard to the supernatural order and not merely a capacity and suitability for the supernatural such as has at all times been emphasized by Catholic apologists" (Encyclical "Pascendi").<br><br>RIPALDA, De ente supernaturali (Paris, 1870); SCHRADER, De triplici ordine (Vienna, 1864); TERRIEN, La grace et la gloire (Paris, 1897); BAINVEL, Nature et surnaturel (Paris, 1903); DE BROGLIE, Le surnaturel (Paris, 1908); LIGEARD, Le rapport de la nature et du surnaturel d'après les théologiens scolastiques du XIIIe au XVIIIe siècles (Paris, 1910).

“We are many times controllers of faith, instead of becoming facilitators of the faith of the people.”
— Pope Francis
<br>The problem: Right now, many of the faithful are being restricted from fully sharing Scripture and other teachings of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> in the most effective ways. We need to be flooding the world with the lumen fidei—the light of faith—yet there are current <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> policies preventing this from happening.<br>The current licensing policies for the most essential texts and teachings of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> (e.g. the Bible, the Catechism, encyclicals, etc.) are making it difficult, expensive, or impossible for Catholics to fairly reproduce and share them. This well-meaning but imprudent policy is directly hampering the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>’s evangelistic mission (as is clearly shown below).<br>It doesn’t have to be this way! There is a just and easy solution that will both:<br>
<br>protect the integrity of these important texts
<br>and free them to be shared and consumed by more people throughout the world.
<br>(The solution I propose distributes these essential texts using a Creative Commons-Attribution-NoDerivs license. I explain this below. Though it wasn’t planned, Jonathan Sullivan coincidentally published a great post today titled Publishing Under Creative Commons: A Primer for Parishes and Dicoeses.)<br>But we need your help in asking the Holy See (and, by extension, the USCCB) to update this policy.<br>If you would like to see Scripture and the official teachings of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> set free so that more people can share and consume them (while still protecting the integrity of the texts), we need your support!<br><br>

<br>If you still have questions or want to learn more about the background behind this movement, and the unfortunate stories that inspired it, please read the full manifesto below.<br>Let’s <a href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com?query=tag:FreeTheWord" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#FreeTheWord</a>!<br><br><br>A couple weeks ago, Pope Francis announced that on Friday, July 5 he would release his first encyclical, Lumen Fidei (The Light of Faith). The “work of four hands” would explore the theological virtue of Faith and I was thrilled. I had already gobbled up Pope Benedict’s encyclicals on Hope and Charity, and could not wait for this one.<br>I was particularly excited to share the document with others. I wanted to discuss it with friends and invite unbelievers to read it, too. To that end, I had an idea: when the encyclical was released, I’d convert it, free of charge, to other popular formats like Kindle, Nook, iPad, and more. That would help thousands of people immediately engage the text, many of whom would otherwise never check it out (like people who exclusively use e-readers).<br>At 6:01am ET on Friday morning, the Holy See posted the text online. As I expected, it was only available as plain text on difficult-to-read parchment background.<br>(The Holy See later made two great adjustments. They switched to a white background, which is much easier on the eyes, and added helpful social media icons to share the encyclical via Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and email. A couple hours later they also posted a PDF version, but it’s oddly sized (5.5″ x 8.5″) making it difficult to print. And since PDFs don’t scale or flow on e-readers, they’re almost impossible to read anywhere but a computer.)<br>As soon as the encyclical went live I copied it over to a blank document, and over the next seven minutes I translated it into several eBook formats. I put them online, shared the links, and soon hundreds of comments and emails began pouring in from people saying, “Thanks! I only read on Kindle so without this, I probably wouldn’t have read the encyclical” or “This is great! Now I can read it on my iPad.”<br>I was so happy to help, but there was one big problem: I was wrong. I quickly received a litany of emails from the USCCB and Holy See, explaining that they had a clear and legitimate copyright on the text. And since I had no permission to share it, I was engaging in illegal activity. The folks could have, perhaps, used softer language—I was accused of “[violating] both civil and moral law” and “stealing from the pope”—but they were unquestionably within their rights to ask me to remove the eBooks.<br>In good faith, I complied. I took the documents down, admitted I was wrong, and publicly and privately apologized (especially for accusing them of valuing profit over catechesis, which was a regretful knee-jerk reaction.) Just to be clear, I’ll apologize again here: to the USCCB, the Holy See, the Libreria Editrice Vaticana (LEV), and our Holy Father, I’m deeply sorry for overstepping my bounds and disseminating the encyclical without permission. I was wrong and should not have done that. My intention was simply to spread the Pope’s teaching but good intentions do not justify violating the Vatican’s copyright.<br>So if that’s the case, then why this post? Well, I’m not writing on that particular incident but on a much deeper and more serious problem it brought to light: the fact that <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> institutions are restricting the spread of the most important truths of our faith—Scripture, the Catechism, papal and conciliar documents, the Roman Missal, and other liturgical texts—through needlessly prohibitive licensing.<br>Before going further, I want to be very clear. I’m not claiming in this article that the USCCB and Holy See were wrong to enforce their legitimate copyright on Lumen Fidei. Nor am I suggesting they had no right to copyright that and other texts. In fact, they should retain their rights to these texts.<br>What I’m proposing is that there must be a better way to license their copyrighted material. The Holy See has a right to restrict its texts as much as it likes. But as we’ll see, its current policy hampers the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>’s evangelistic mission. Pope Paul VI reminded us in 1975 that “[the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>] exists in order to evangelize” (Evangelii Nuntiandi, 14). That’s our first and most basic task, and any policy the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> institutes should help that mission, not limit it.<br>
“Then John said in reply, ‘Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow in our company.’
Jesus said to him, ‘Do not prevent him, for whoever is not against you is for you.'”
— Luke 9:49-50
<br><br>The Lumen Fidei situation provoked lots of discussion about the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>’s copyright policy, but this is a conversation that has been going on for years. Some commentators, such as Dawn Eden and Phil Lawler, like the current policy. Phil writes:<br>
“The Pope is a universal teacher, and when he speaks or writes, his aides at the Vatican hope that his message will go out to the widest possible audience. The Vatican’s policies are designed not to restrict public access to the Pope’s teachings, but to ensure that the teachings are conveyed fully and accurately.
Copyright laws are enacted to protect authors from potential exploitation. The Vatican argues, not unreasonably, that even the Pope deserves that protection.”
<br>(UPDATE: Apparently I misunderstood Phil’s article. He just tweeted me to say, “Not sure why you cite me as disagreeing with you on this; actually I agree 100%.”)<br>It’s important to note here that the question is not, as some suggest, whether the Holy See should retain copyrights. They should. What I’m concerned with is the restrictive licensing and access to those texts.<br>Many others agree. In 2006, Dr. Jeff Mirus articulated the main criticism:<br>
“This policy is…based on a view of truth more governed by contemporary positive law than by the traditional Catholic dictum that truth is the property of all. When bishops release documents in which they purport to expound the truth, they should be more than happy to have their words picked up by others and circulated as much as possible. This should be true even if criticism sometimes accompanies such circulation. Legal remedies should be employed only if altered texts are passed off as authentic.”
<br>Several commentators have since added their voices in agreement, including:<br>
<br>Fr. Roderick Vonhögen
<br>Happy Catholic
<br>Jeff Geerling
<br>Jeff Miller
<br>John Clem
<br>Jonathan Sullivan
<br>Mark Shea
<br>New Liturgical Movement
<br>Simcha Fisher
<br>Truth and Charity
<br>Many have made the same point, that the current copyright policy curbs evangelization, and this resonates with my experience. Over the last year or so, I’ve heard from several Catholics, each attempting little more than to spread <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teachings, who have been shut down because of the restrictive policy.<br>Perhaps the most egregious example was Matt Warner and his “Read the Catechism in a Year” project. Anticipating the Year of Faith in October 2012, Pope Benedict XVI encouraged all Catholics to study and reflect on the Catechism of the Catholic <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>, a book his predecessor called “a sure norm for teaching the faith.”<br>That gave Matt an idea. He launched the “Read the Catechism in a Year” project as a simple way to help people read it throughout the Year of Faith. People signed up and began receiving excerpts of the Catechism each day in their email. By reading the little excerpts they would read the whole Catechism in a year.<br>It was a great idea and really took off. Within weeks, the project attracted over 100,000 subscribers, making it the largest catechetical study group in the history of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>.<br>However a few months in, Matt was surprised by a letter from the USCCB. It explained that he did not have permission to share the Catechism and that he needed to shut down his project immediately. Confused and frustrated, Matt replied with an apology, asking if there was a better solution than shutting it down—perhaps partnering with the USCCB, or someone else with proper permissions. He was willing to do anything to keep the project running for the readers’ sake. But in response, he received another cease and desist letter, mailed to his house, this one from the USCCB lawyers.<br>Despite helping thousands of people read the Catechism each day, most of whom would never have read it otherwise, there seemed to be no openness to continuing the project.<br>(Thankfully, Ignatius Press stepped in and allowed Matt to excerpt from the simpler YOUCAT. It’s nice, but not the same as spreading the official Catechism.)<br>I’ve heard many other stories like this. For example, Verbum Domini, one of the first Catholic podcasts online, recorded the daily Mass readings so people could download them on their iPods. Yet they were ordered to stop the recordings. Despite being a volunteer project, given away for free to listeners around the world, they couldn’t spread the readings proclaimed each day in Mass.<br>Other podcasters have received aggressive cease and desist emails for simply praying or reading texts from the Roman Missal. Some were shut down for posting free audio recordings of the breviary. One friend, who worked as the Director of Web Development for a major Archdiocese, was reprimanded three different times for simply integrating the Bible, Catechism, and Mass translations into diocesan websites and apps.<br>More recently, my friend Jeff Miller shut down his popular “Weekly Francis/Benedict” project where he collected the Pope’s audiences, speeches, and writings. Each week he formatted them for free into a single eBook, downloadable in Kindle or ePub formats. Thousands of people downloaded the eBooks and discovered the Pope’s teachings, many for the first time.<br>This frustration hasn’t only hit bloggers and podcasters. Catholic publishers have been affected, too. Some publishing friends shared that the licensing fees they’re forced to pay in order to print the Bible, Catechism, or papal documents make it nearly impossible to break even. They’re forced to either mark up their books or just not publish them at all. Neither is a good option if the goal is to spread the teachings far and wide.<br>The problem ultimately boils down to this: the Holy See (and thus, by effect, the USCCB) has constricted the spread of the most basic <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teachings by making it difficult, expensive, or impossible to reproduce and share them.<br>The debilitating effects of this well-meaning policy are tragic and should frustrate all Catholics intent on evangelizing the world.<br>
“It is quite unbecoming for the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>’s children idly to permit the message of salvation to be thwarted or impeded by the technical delays or expenses, however vast, which are encountered by the very nature of the media.”
— Inter Mirifica, 17
<br><br>Thankfully, it doesn’t have to be like this. There are plenty of solutions that both protect the integrity of <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teaching while also granting free access to share it. One stands out and it’s been suggested by many people:<br>Release all magisterial teaching under a Creative Commons-Attribution-NoDerivs license.<br>Here’s what each of the elements in that fancy, technical name means:<br>
<br>Creative Commons – A type of license that lets you share your work generously without losing your control over it
<br>Attribution – Requires that proper credit be noted on any reproduction
<br>NoDerivs – Prohibits changing or altering the work, or producing derivative versions
<br>Under this license, people may copy, distribute, display, and perform only verbatim copies of the work. It’s an extremely popular way of safely distributing texts, especially digital content. In fact, over 400 million <a data-href="Creative Commons Licenses" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Electricity/Computers/License/Creative Commons Licenses.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Creative Commons Licenses</a> have been deployed by individuals and large organizations, including Wikipedia. (The Creative Commons is partly why Wikipedia appears at the top of nearly every Google search page. The site is so popular because people routinely share its content. If the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> allows us to share her teachings freely and easily, we too would rise up in the search rankings.)<br>Surprisingly, the USCCB already does this for many of the resources available on its web site. For instance, the 2013 Catechetical Sunday materials contain this disclaimer:<br>
Copyright © 2013, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Washington, DC. All rights reserved. Permission is hereby granted to duplicate this work without adaptation for non-commercial use.
<br>It’s a great idea and should be applied to all official <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> resources, not just some.<br>Just to be extra clear, the Holy See and USCCB would still hold the copyrights to magisterial documents. They would still maintain their legal right and ability to prosecute anyone caught manipulating the text. Therefore they would maintain the textual integrity as much as they do now.<br>But the Creative Commons license would allow people interested in spreading <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teaching to do so freely. It would help bloggers, podcasters, artists, catechists, writers, publishers, and mobile app developers to freely integrate this content into their work and share it with the world.<br>
“Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give”
— Matthew 10:1
<br><br>Q1: But what about print versions? We can’t just give books away for free!<br>I agree and that’s not what I’m advocating. It costs large sums of money to print, edit, market, and produce print documents, and publishers should be justly compensated. But they shouldn’t have to pay extra licensing fees on top of that to print and distribute basic <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teachings.<br>These extra and exorbitant fees, which often run thousands of dollars, prevent many groups from ever publishing these texts—which seems counterproductive—or it inflates the price and discourages consumers from buying them.<br>Q2: What about personal writings like Pope Benedict’s Jesus of Nazareth series? Should those be released for free?<br>Of course not. We must distinguish between the core teachings of the magisterium like the Bible, Catechism, and papal documents—official <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> texts meant for the entire world—and the work of private men and women. There’s a substantial difference between a Catholic writing a personal book, and the Pope or bishops exercising their magisterial role.<br>In the case of Pope Benedict, he chose to have the LEV manage all his private writings and collect the royalties. That was his decision to make and there is nothing wrong with it. But magisterial texts are a different story. Those should be freely available for everyone to copy and distribute.<br>Q3: What about providing a just wage to those who labored to produce these documents?<br>Catholic social teaching affirms that “A just wage is the legitimate fruit of work. To refuse or withhold it can be a grave injustice” (CCC, 2434). I wholeheartedly agree. But we must ask, haven’t we already paid just wages for these texts? The New American Bible was produced decades ago and the Catechism is twenty years old. It’s not clear how much money Catholics are still on the hook for. If there is a specific dollar amount, we could perhaps fund-raise that money and fulfill our obligations, then allowing free distribution.<br>But here’s the bigger issue. Whatever wages the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> still owes to authors and translators should, if nothing else, be considered sunk costs. In any organization, there are resources you must expend to fulfill your basic mission—rent, furniture, electricity, equipment, and even costs related to staffing.<br>Translating and disseminating <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teaching is in the same category. It shouldn’t be an extra task we have to support through outside means. Making these texts available is among the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>’s most basic and foundational responsibilities. Those costs should already be accounted for through the giving of the faithful, not recouped through excessive royalties and licensing fees. As Lumen Gentium reminds, “The laity have the right, as do all Christians, to receive in abundance from their spiritual shepherds the spiritual goods of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>, especially the assistance of the word of God…” (LG, 37).<br>When Catholics give money to their parishes, dioceses, USCCB, or the Holy See, at the very least they should expect to receive free and open access to <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teaching.<br>Q4: Why are you trying to undermine the magisterium’s authority?<br>I’m doing just the opposite. I’m trying to honor and extend their authority by spreading magisterial teachings. I’m not trying to undermine or change these texts, I’m trying to promote them. I want millions more people—Catholics and non-Catholics alike—to discover the treasures of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>, specifically the writings of our remarkable Holy Father and his brother bishops. However, it’s hard to spread these teachings freely and quickly when there’s so many restrictions.<br>Q5: Why publicly criticize the bishops and the Pope? Why not address this in private?<br>I’m not criticizing any groups or individuals, only the policy. In my experience, the people behind this policy are kind and well-intentioned. But the unforeseen result of the imprudent policy is that it restricts evangelization. I think we can fix it and I’m simply suggesting a better solution.<br>Also, it should be noted that in the spirit of Matthew 18:15-20, I and others have addressed this issue privately over the last year. We’ve exchanged several messages with the USCCB, we’ve discussed it with multiple bishops, and we’ve reached out to the Vatican. Yet we were met mostly with resistance or ambivalence. We hope that by bringing this issue to the public light we will not only draw more attention to the problem, but raise the chance that together we can come up with a better solution. The more minds working on this conundrum, the better!<br>Q6: What about canons 828 and 829?<br>Canon 828 reads:<br>
“It is not permitted to reprint collections of decrees or acts published by some ecclesiastical authority unless the prior permission of the same authority has been obtained and the conditions prescribed by it have been observed.”
<br>According to the New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law by John Beal, “The obvious concern [of this canon is] the accuracy and completeness of [<a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> documents]…The canon is a rather curious remnant of Pope Leo XIII’s 1887 constitution on the prohibition and censure of books on which the 1917 code’s treatment of this whole area was based.”<br>Canon 829 reads:<br>
“The approval or permission to publish some work is valid for the original text but not for new editions or translations of the same.”
<br>The New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law explains, “When ecclesiastical approval for a publication is obtained, it applies only to the original text submitted for judgment, not to subsequent editions of translations of it. Those latter texts could vary substantially from the original. However, a simple reprinting of the original work is not considered a new edition.”<br>From the canon law experts I’ve talked with, neither of these canons are concerned with copyright issues, much less digital permissions. They’re primarily interested in maintaining the doctrinal integrity of <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> documents. And of course, I and others would agree with that noble end. The solution I proposed achieves that. (I certainly welcome other canon law perspectives in the comment boxes.)<br>Q7: The documents are already available free at Vatican.va and USCCB.org so what’s the problem?<br>This is perhaps the most common response I’ve heard from critics. On the surface it makes sense: why should the Vatican let websites, apps, and publishers reproduce <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> texts for free when they already offer it free on their websites?<br>The problem is that from an evangelistic perspective, posting documents in one or two places is simply not enough. St. Paul never said, “Well, Peter is preaching the Gospel so I probably don’t need to.” Mother Angelica never thought, “Well, there’s already some Catholic television shows so mine aren’t needed.” No parish has ever said, “People can hear the Bible at Mass so what’s the point of stocking paper versions in our library?”<br>It’s great that these magisterial documents are available free online in a couple places, but they should be freely accessible everywhere. Why only proclaim the Gospel in one place, to one audience, in one format, when we can share it in many more places and ways?<br>Also, on a more technical note, the documents available at Vatican.va are mostly unreadable on mobile devices. The websites are non-responsive, which means the text doesn’t resize on your phone or tablet, a huge problem since studies show mobile internet users will trump desktop internet users by 2015. Those who want to read <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> documents on their computer can do so on these sites, but mobile users find it much more challenging. These are precisely the types of problems we’ll solve by releasing the texts to capable and willing mobile developers. Let’s take advantage of the many technical talents within the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>.<br>Q8: Why can’t someone just print a document out from Vatican.va or USCCB.org, or convert to an eBook himself?<br>They can, but this is illegal (even if it’s rarely enforced.) On March 19, 2011, the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State released a revised “Law on the Protection of Copyright and Related Rights”. Article 4, §3 reads:<br>
“Reproduction in another format is considered, to all legal intents and purposes, to be a new publication of the work.”
<br>And if you don’t have specific permission to reproduce that document in a new form (i.e. print it or convert it), then you’d be violating the law.<br>Now, most of us would think that’s silly and I’m sure many <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> leaders would agree. But that’s the result of the current restrictive policy.<br>Q9: The <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> already allows some groups to reproduce the documents online and offline, right?<br>Sure, but the process is not at all transparent. For instance, it’s not evident why some projects get a green light and others red. It’s also unclear how much someone has to pay to say, reproduce a chapter from the Bible or pray the Divine Office on a podcast.<br>I and others have asked these questions privately without response. In particular, when Matt Warner’s Catechism project was shut down, there was absolutely no openness to continuing the project even when Matt offered to pay the appropriate licensing fees, whatever they were.<br>There also seems to be inconsistencies with the policy, such as demanding the removals of Lumen Fidei eBooks while allowing others to post audio book versions of the same text.<br>Q10: Why not the Creative Commons Non-Commercial license?<br>Because nobody should have to pay for the right to distribute sacred texts. It shouldn’t matter whether you’re a volunteer, a small apostolate, a Catholic business, or a large publisher. If the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>’s goal is to evangelize, we want all of those people spreading the word.<br>Some of the most innovative Catholics work for Catholic companies and <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> organizations. Why prohibit them from integrating the documents into their websites, apps, software, and podcasts?<br>Q11: What makes you think you’re so bright as to solve this problem? You don’t know what you’re talking about.<br>That may be true. One USCCB leader said in an email to me, “It is obvious that you have not studied this issue at length” and they could be right. Perhaps the Creative Commons license isn’t the best way to solve this problem, but nevertheless we can’t avoid the fact that there is a problem.<br>Regardless of which solution is best, or who proposes it, we need to figure out how to solve this dilemma, how to protect the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>’s teachings without restricting eager evangelists. I welcome feedback from the USCCB, Holy See, and anyone else concerned about this issue.<br>Q12: What benefits should the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> expect if she freely licensed her documents?<br>Hundreds of talented Catholics have already dreamed up creative ways to spread <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teaching, but aren’t able to implement them (yet) because of the current policy. I’ve seen several exciting, ready-to-go ideas like new interactive websites, mobile apps, podcasts, and video series. These vehicles would spread <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teaching to millions of new people, in new ways, through the new media.<br>(Note: Many of these Catholics are already doing innovative things with Scripture and prayer, but they are forced to use non-official translations of <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> texts. That’s a shame and a missed opportunity to spread official Catholic texts rather than substitutes. Many tech-savvy Catholics end up using non-Catholic Scripture simply because it’s the only version convenient for them on a particular app, website, or interface.)<br>We only need to turn to our Protestant brothers and sisters to glimpse the potential. The free, volunteer-produced YouVersion Bible App garnered its 100 millionth install last week. Users have so far spent over 58 billion minutes engaging Scripture, and it’s now the most popular religious app in the world.<br>That’s the innovation you get when you allow Christians to maximize their gifts in service of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>. It’s time we Catholics followed suit. We need to unleash our own creative energies and help <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teaching go viral.<br>
“What then is my recompense? That, when I preach, I offer the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.”
— 1 Corinthians 9:18
<br><br>It’s no secret that the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> faces many problems. Today, we’re particularly plagued by poor catechesis and engagement. Only half of the faithful believe in the Real Presence of the Eucharist (and less than half can identify Genesis as the first book in the Bible.) Three-quarters of our own people skip Mass every week. And “former Catholics” make up the nation’s second-largest Christian group.<br>The best solution to these tragedies is not to restrict the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>’s treasure but to spread it liberally. We must not dampen the lumen fidei under a basket, but flood the world with its brilliant rays.<br>By tweaking the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>’s copyright policy to allow open distribution, we’ll maintain the integrity of the teachings and ensure they reach millions of new people. That’s what the New Evangelization is all about, and that’s why this change is so desperately needed.<br>
“In the Christian life, even in the life of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>, there are old structures, passing structures: it is necessary to renew them!”

 <br>A parish is a territorial entity in many Christian denominations, constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a priest, often termed a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor. Its association with the parish church remains paramount.<br>By extension the term parish refers not only to the territorial entity but to the people of its community or congregation as well as to church property within it. In England this church property was technically in ownership of the parish priest ex-officio, vested in him on his institution to that parish.<br>Further Reading:<br>

 <br>A name given in the New Testament to Christians generally (Colossians 1:2) but early restricted to persons who were eminent for holiness. In the strict sense saints are those who distinguish themselves by heroic virtue during life and whom the Church honors as saints either by her ordinary universal teaching authority or by a solemn definition called canonization. The Church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the persons are now in heavenly glory, that they may be publicly invoked everywhere, and that their virtues during life or martyr's death are a witness and example to the Christian faithful.

 <br>Ivan Dominic Illich ( iv-AHN IL-itch, German: [ˈiːvan ˈɪlɪtʃ]; 4 September 1926 – 2 December 2002) was an Austrian Roman Catholic priest, theologian, philosopher, and social critic. His 1971 book <a data-href="Deschooling Society" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/Media/Books/Deschooling Society.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deschooling Society</a> criticises modern society's institutional approach to education, an approach that constrains learning to narrow situations in a fairly short period of the human lifespan. His 1975 book Medical Nemesis, importing to the sociology of medicine the concept of medical harm, argues that industrialised society widely impairs quality of life by overmedicalising life, pathologizing normal conditions, creating false dependency, and limiting other more healthful solutions. Illich called himself "an errant pilgrim."<br><br><br>Ivan Dominic Illich was born on 4 September 1926 in Vienna, Austria, to Gian Pietro Ilic (Ivan Peter Illich) and Ellen Rose "Maexie" née Regenstreif-Ortlieb. His father was a civil engineer and a diplomat from a landed Catholic family of Dalmatia, with property in the city of Split and wine and olive oil estates on the island of Brač. His mother came from a Jewish family that had converted to Christianity from Germany and Austria-Hungary (Czernowitz, Bukowina). Ellen Illich was baptized Lutheran but converted to Catholicism upon marriage. Her father, Friedrich "Fritz" Regenstreif, was an industrialist who made his money in the lumber trade in Bosnia, later settling in Vienna, where he built an art nouveau villa.<br>Ellen Illich traveled to Vienna to be attended by the best doctors during birth. Ivan's father was not living in Central Europe at the time. When Ivan was three months old, he was taken along with his nurse to Split, Dalmatia (by then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), to be shown to his paternal grandfather. There he was baptized on 1 December 1926. In 1929 twin boys, Alexander and Michael, were born in the family.<br><br>In 1942, Ellen Illich and her three children—Ivan, Alexander, and Michael—left Vienna, Austria for Florence, Italy, escaping the Nazi persecution of Jews. Illich finished high school in Florence, and then went on to study histology and crystallography at the local University of Florence. Hoping to return to Austria following World War II, he enrolled in a doctorate in medieval history at the University of Salzburg with the hope of gaining legal residency as he was undocumented. He wrote a dissertation focusing on the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, a subject to which he would return in his later years. While working on his doctorate, he returned to Italy where he studied theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, as he wanted to become a Catholic priest. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in Rome in 1951 and served his first Mass in the catacombs where the early Roman Christians hid from their persecutors.<br>A polyglot, Illich spoke Italian, Spanish, French, and German fluently. He later learned Croatian, the language of his grandfathers, then Ancient Greek and Latin, in addition to Portuguese, Hindi, English, and other languages.<br>Following his ordination in 1951, he "signed up to become a parish priest in one of New York's poorest neighborhoods—Washington Heights, on the northern tip of Manhattan, at that time a barrio of newly-arrived Puerto Rican immigrants." In 1956, at the age of 30, he was appointed vice rector of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, "a position he managed to keep for several years before getting thrown out—Illich was just a little too loud in his criticism of the Vatican's pronouncements on birth control and comparatively demure silence about the nuclear bomb." It was in Puerto Rico that Illich met Everett Reimer, and the two began to analyze their own functions as "educational" leaders. In 1959, he traveled throughout South America on foot and by bus.<br>The end of Illich's tenure at the university came in 1960 as the result of a controversy involving bishops James Edward McManus and James Peter Davis, who had denounced Governor Luis Muñoz Marín and his Popular Democratic Party for their positions in favor of birth control and divorce. The bishops also started their own rival Catholic party. Illich later summarized his opposition:<br>
As a historian, I saw that it violated the American tradition of Church and State separation. As a politician, I predicted that there wasn't enough strength in Catholic ranks to create a meaningful platform and that failure of McManus's party would be disastrous on the already frail prestige of the Puerto Rican Church. As a theologian, I believe that the Church must always condemn injustice in the light of the Gospel, but never has the right to speak in favor of a specific political party.
<br>After Illich disobeyed a direct order from McManus forbidding all priests from dining with Governor Muñoz, McManus ordered Illich to leave his post at the university, describing his presence as "dangerous to the Diocese of Ponce and its institutions."<br>Despite this display of insubordination and an order from Paul Francis Tanner, then general secretary of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, forbidding Illich from any official role in the organization's Latin American bureau, Illich maintained the support of the influential priest John J. Considine, who continued to push for Illich to have a role in training the Church's missionaries, personally funding trips to Mexico in order for Illich to scout locations.<br>Following his departure from Puerto Rico, Illich moved to Cuernavaca, Mexico, where he founded the Center of Intercultural Formation (CIF) in 1961, originally as a missionary training center. As the center became more influential, it became the Centro Intercultural de Documentación (CIDOC, or Intercultural Documentation Center), ostensibly a research center offering language courses to missionaries from North America and volunteers of the Alliance for Progress program initiated by John F. Kennedy. His real intent was to document the participation of the Vatican in the "modern development" of the so-called Third World. Illich looked askance at the liberal pity or conservative imperiousness that motivated the rising tide of global industrial development. He viewed such emissaries as a form of industrial hegemony and, as such, an act of "war on subsistence". He sought to teach missionaries dispatched by the Church not to impose their own cultural values. "Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, CIDOC was part language school and part free university for intellectuals from all over the Americas." At the CIDOC, "Illich was able to develop his potent and highly influential critique of Third World development schemes and their fresh-faced agents: Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps, and countless other missionary efforts bankrolled and organized by wealthy nations, foundations, and religious groups."<br>After ten years, critical analysis from the CIDOC of the institutional actions by the Church brought the organization into conflict with the Vatican. Unpopular with the local chapter of Opus Dei, Illich was called to Rome for questioning, due in part to a CIA report. While he was not convicted or punished by the Vatican, it was then that he decided to renounce active priesthood. In 1976, apparently concerned by the influx of formal academics and the potential side effects of its own "institutionalization", Illich shut the center down with consent from the other members of the CIDOC. Several of the members subsequently continued language schools in Cuernavaca, some of which still exist. Illich, who had been made a monsignor at 33, himself resigned from the active priesthood in the late 1960s but continued to identify as a priest and occasionally performed private masses.<br>In the 1970s, Illich was popular among leftist intellectuals in France, his thesis having been discussed in particular by André Gorz. However, his influence declined after the 1981 election of François Mitterrand, as Illich was considered too pessimistic at a time when the French Left took control of the government.<br>In the 1980s and beyond, Illich traveled extensively, mainly splitting his time between the United States, Mexico, and Germany. He held an appointment as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy, Science, Technology, and Society at Penn State. He also taught at the University of Bremen and University of Hagen. During the last days of his life he admitted that he was greatly influenced by one of the Indian economists and adviser to M.&nbsp;K. Gandhi, J.&nbsp;C. Kumarappa, most notably his book, Economy of Permanence.<br>While Illich never referred to himself as an anarchist in print, he was closely associated with major figures in left-anarchist circles, notably Paul Goodman and unschooling advocate John Holt. Goodman is credited in <a data-href="Deschooling Society" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/Media/Books/Deschooling Society.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deschooling Society</a> with having "radically obliged" Illich to revise his thinking and is described with great affection in Illich's 1990s interviews with David Cayley:<br>
... I loved Goodman very much, but not from the beginning. In 1951, as a twenty-six-year-old man newly arrived in New York, I went to a public debate. This strange person arrived and fascinated everybody with his way of presenting himself. I was just then having my first experiences of sitting through cold turkey with neighbourhood kids from Washington Heights, and this guy carefully phrased his proposal that New York immediately decriminalize all substances you can ingest, because otherwise the city of New York would become an unlivable city within the next few years. He had recently played a major part in getting a law passed which recognized that the state should not interfere with the private activities of consenting adults. Well, I was shocked! I would not have suspected that within three of four years we would be good friends and that during the last part of his life he would spend considerable time with me in Cuernavaca. I consider Goodman one of the great thinkers I've known, and also a tender, touching person.
<br><br>Ivan Illich called himself "an errant pilgrim", "a wandering Jew and a Christian pilgrim", while clearly acknowledging his Dalmatian roots. He remarked that since leaving the old house of his grandparents on the island Brač in Dalmatia, he had never had a home.<br><br>Illich died on 2 December 2002 in Bremen, Germany. Not realised was his last wish: to die surrounded by close collaborators in Bologna amid the creation of his planned, new learning centre.<br><br>Illich followed the tradition of apophatic theology. His lifework's leading thesis is that Western modernity, perverting Christianity, corrupts Western Christianity. A perverse attempt to encode the New Testament's principles as rules of behavior, duty, or laws, and to institutionalize them, without limits, is a corruption that Illich detailed in his analyses of modern Western institutions, including education, charity, and medicine, among others. Illich often used the Latin phrase Corruptio optimi quae est pessima, in English The corruption of the best is the worst.<br>Illich believed that the Biblical <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> taking human form, the Incarnation, marked world history's turning point, opening new possibilities for love and knowledge. As in the First Epistle of John, it invites any believer to seek <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>'s face in everyone encountered. Describing this new possibility for love, Illich refers to the Parable of the Good Samaritan.<br><br>His first book, <a data-href="Deschooling Society" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/Media/Books/Deschooling Society.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deschooling Society</a>, published in 1971, was a groundbreaking critique of compulsory mass education. He argued the oppressive structure of the school system could not be reformed. It must be dismantled in order to free humanity from the crippling effects of the institutionalization of all of life. He went on to critique modern mass medicine. Illich was highly influential among intellectuals and academics. He became known worldwide for his progressive polemics about how activity expressive of truly human values could be preserved and expanded in human culture in the face of multiple thundering forces of de-humanization.<br>In his several influential books, he argued that the overuse of the benefits of many modern technologies and social arrangements undermine human values and human self-sufficiency, freedom, and dignity. His in-depth critiques of mass education and modern mass medicine were especially, pointed, relevant; and perhaps, more timely now than during his life.<br>Health, argues Illich, is the capacity to cope with the human reality of death, pain, and sickness. Technology can benefit many; yet, modern mass medicine has gone too far, launching into a godlike battle to eradicate death, pain, and sickness. In doing so, it turns people into risk-averse consuming objects, turning healing into mere science, turning medical healers into mere drug-surgical technicians.<br>The Dark Mountain Project, a creative cultural movement founded by Dougald Hine and Paul Kingsnorth that abandons the myths of modern societies and looks for other new stories that help us make sense of modernity, drew their inspiration from the ideas of Ivan Illich.<br><br><br>Illich gained public attention with his 1971 book <a data-href="Deschooling Society" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/Media/Books/Deschooling Society.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deschooling Society</a>, a radical critique of educational practice in "modern" economies. Claiming examples of institutionalised education's ineffectiveness, Illich endorses self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations, in fluid informal arrangements:<br>
Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education—and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.
<br>The final sentence, above, clarifies Illich's view that education's institutionalisation fosters society's institutionalisation, and so de-institutionalising education may help de-institutionalize society. Further, Illich suggests reinventing learning and expanding it throughout society and across persons' lifespans. Particularly striking in 1971 was his call for advanced technology to support "learning webs":<br>
The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad scale for publicly valued activity.
<br>According to a contemporary review in the Libertarian Forum, "Illich's advocacy of the free market in education is the bone in the throat that is choking the public educators." Yet, unlike libertarians, Illich opposes not merely publicly funded schooling, but schools as such. Thus, Illich's envisioned disestablishment of schools aimed not to establish a free market in educational services, but to attain a fundamental shift: a deschooled society. In his 1973 book After Deschooling, What?, he asserted, "We can disestablish schools, or we can deschool culture." In fact, he called advocates of free-market education "the most dangerous category of educational reformers."<br><br>Tools for Conviviality was published in 1973, two years after <a data-href="Deschooling Society" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/Media/Books/Deschooling Society.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deschooling Society</a>. In this newer work, Illich generalizes the themes that he had previously applied to the educational field: the institutionalization of specialized knowledge, the dominant role of technocratic elites in industrial society, and the need to develop new instruments for the reconquest of practical knowledge by the average citizen. He wrote that "[e]lite professional groups ... have come to exert a 'radical monopoly' on such basic human activities as health, agriculture, home-building, and learning, leading to a 'war on subsistence' that robs peasant societies of their vital skills and know-how. The result of much economic development is very often not human flourishing but 'modernized poverty', dependency, and an out-of-control system in which the humans become worn-down mechanical parts." Illich proposed that we should "invert the present deep structure of tools" in order to "give people tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency."<br>Tools for Conviviality attracted worldwide attention. A résumé of it was published by French social philosopher André Gorz in Les Temps Modernes, under the title "Freeing the Future". The book's vision of tools that would be developed and maintained by a community of users had a significant influence on the first developers of the personal computer, notably Lee Felsenstein.<br><br>In his Medical Nemesis, first published in 1975, also known as Limits to Medicine, Illich subjected contemporary Western medicine to detailed attack. He argued that the medicalization in recent decades of so many of life's vicissitudes—birth and death, for example—frequently caused more harm than good and rendered many people in effect lifelong patients. He marshalled a body of statistics to show what he considered the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects and drug-induced illness in advanced industrial society. He introduced to a wider public the notion of iatrogenic disease, which had been scientifically established a century earlier by British nurse Florence Nightingale (1820–1910). Others have since voiced similar views.<br><br>In his 1968 speech at the Conference on InterAmerican Student Projects (CIASP), Illich strongly opposes the presence of American Roman Catholic missionaries, the Peace Corps and organizations like the CIASP themselves who invited him to speak- in Mexico. Illich says that the presence of American "do-gooders" is causing more harm than good. Rather, he suggests that the Americans should travel to Latin America as tourists or students, or else stay in their homeland, where they can at least know what they are doing.<br><br>

<br>David Tinapple Collection of Ivan Illich's speeches and books
<br>The International Journal of Illich Studies — an open access, interdisciplinary, peer-reviewed annual publication engaging the thought/writing of Ivan Illich and his circle.
<br><br><br>By Nathan Gardels, editor-in-chief of Noema Magazine.<br>August 13, 2021 <br>Beset as we are these days by the cascading consequences of climate change and the descent into dysfunction of our social institutions, it is worth remembering Ivan Illich, a forgotten prophet whose time has come.&nbsp;<br>Fortunately, two books on the 1970s apostle of the era of limits remind us of his prescient relevance: “Ivan Illich: An Intellectual Journey” published by his friend and long-time interlocutor David Cayley this year, and “The Prophet of Cuernavaca: Ivan Illich and the Crisis of the West” by Todd Hartch.&nbsp;<br>Cayley’s book benefits from his long personal acquaintance and countless conversations over the years with Illich. Hartch, who never met Illich, offers a more objective account informed by critical distance from his subject. Both trace Illich from his early days as a parish priest in the impoverished Puerto Rican neighborhoods of New York to becoming vice-rector of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico to the long period in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where he sought to de-imperialize Catholic missionaries and hosted the radical thinkers of his day, to the striking story of his suffering and demise.<br>Illich was a purveyor of impossible truths, truths so radical that they questioned the very foundations of modern certitudes — progress, economic growth, health, education, mobility. While he was not wrong, we had all been riding on a train going in the opposite direction for so long that it was hard to see how, in any practical sense, the momentum could ever be stalled. And that was his point. Now that “the shadow our future throws” of which Illich warned is darkening the skies of the present, it is time to reconsider his thought.<br>Illich’s central contention was that persons are relational beings embedded in a matrix of the natural cosmos, convivial community with others and, as a fallen but still faithful priest, <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>’s grace. As the maverick thinker saw it, Western modernity rent asunder this multidimensional oneness of “Life.”&nbsp;<br>For Illich, 17th-century science departed from the past by privileging the role of humans in the cosmos as above and apart from all other being. In doing so, it effectively declared “the death of nature,” turning it into a “resource” to feed the “pleonexia,” or radical greed, which fueled “development” and “progress” that transmuted endless “wants” into “needs.”&nbsp;<br>As Illich saw it, the rise of universalizing social technologies — that is, institutions managed by strangers — transgressed the traditional bounds of diverse vernacular communities and harnessed human endeavor to a trajectory of limitless growth, creating a “radical monopoly” over the ways and means of living that blunted any alternative to industrializing the desires of consumer society. In the process, persons and communities alike were deprived of the practical knowledge to shape tools according to their own defined needs and choices. Robbed of such competence, they became servants to the logic of those institutions instead of the other way around.&nbsp;<br><br>Illich defined conviviality as “autonomous and creative intercourse among persons, and the intercourse of persons with their environment.” He contrasted this to “the conditioned response of persons to the demands made upon them by others” from above and afar in the name of advancing progress. “I consider conviviality to be individual freedom realized in personal interdependence and, as such, an intrinsic ethical value,” he wrote in “Tools for Conviviality.” “I believe that, in any society, as conviviality is reduced below a certain level, no amount of industrial productivity can effectively satisfy the needs it creates among society’s members.”&nbsp;<br>Illich didn’t stop there. His greatest insight was that when conviviality is swapped for productivity, monopolizing institutions that chart a singular path at mass scale become counterproductive to their original intent beyond a certain threshold. In his words, “By breaching the limits set on man by nature and history, industrial society engendered disability and suffering in the name of eliminating disability and suffering. … The warming biosphere is making it intolerable to think of industrial growth as progress; now it appears to us as aggression against the human condition.”&nbsp;<br>In his book “Energy and Equity” Illich illustrated this point in terms all could easily understand. As anyone who has driven on a freeway would agree, individual mobility turns into collective congestion when everyone has a car. In this he was in league with the “small is beautiful” thinkers at the time such as Leopold Kohr and E. F. Schumacher.&nbsp;<br><br>In his radically provocative way, Illich preached the “virtue of enoughness” as the frugal way out of a headlong rush to an untenable future. Indeed, in the 1980s he subsisted in the small hamlet of Ocotepec, about 50 miles from Mexico City, where I visited him one summer along with my wife Lilly and former California Governor Jerry Brown. The streets were unpaved with no streetlights. Packs of feral dogs, chickens and the odd burro roamed freely. Scorpions scuttled across the floors and walls. The austere room where Illich slept was adorned with nothing other than a massive crucifix. At the back of the compound, incongruously, stood a rustic library filled with rare Latin volumes where he labored in “the vineyard of the texts” like one of his idols, Hugh of Saint Victor. Over lunches of watery lentil soup and weak fruit juice, he would often invite over the “Red Bishops” of Cuernavaca and Chiapas for convivial banter. At night we would sit up drinking cheap Presidente brandy, pondering the fate of civilization.<br>Illich carried his theme across the entire institutional landscape of modern society. In one of his most famously controversial books, “<a data-href="Deschooling Society" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/Media/Books/Deschooling Society.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deschooling Society</a>,” he argued that the graduated credentialism of mass education actually made people more ignorant by standardizing what they can know and think about.<br>In those early days of cybernetics, he hoped that the recursive feedback loops of information systems might help foster an “ecology of mind,” as the anthropologist Gregory Bateson framed it, re-embedding the person in the larger matrix of being. Yet he suspected in the end it would not turn out so well, instead feeding the illusion that humans could escape the limits of their condition through their tools. As we have now come to see, the algorithms of Big Tech are, after all, only mathematical institutions programmed to bolster the very modern certitudes Illich fundamentally questioned, accelerating “progress” along an unsustainable trajectory that would continue to wreak ruin on the planet and reduce, not enhance, personal autonomy.<br>Here, too, he echoed other thinkers of his time like Jacques Ellul. The French theologian anticipated the surveillance capitalism of the digital age, believing that a technological society ends up imprisoning personal self-determination instead of liberating it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was perhaps with respect to health that Illich was most radical. He decried “the sacralization of ‘a life’” dis-embedded from the oneness of Life and fetishized as a detached immune system to be managed from sperm to worm by the “brave new biocracy” of modern medicine.&nbsp;<br>For Illich, vaccines, clean water and simple hygiene like washing hands were responsible for most health advances. But he was blistering in his critique of our medical systems oriented toward postponing the end as long as possible. “We now see that a majority of these medical achievements are deceptive misnomers, actually prolonging the suffering of madmen, cripples, old fools and monsters,” he wrote.&nbsp;<br>In his book “Medical Nemesis” Illich spoke of “iatrogenic illness” — illness caused by the “bureaucracy” of physicians who abandoned the ancient idea of health as “balance” within the environment in which a person lived. Such a healthy balance could not be achieved, he argued, in an unhealthy environment poisoned by untamed industrial growth.&nbsp;<br>Illich walked the talk. He suffered in his last years from a cancerous tumor that grew to the size of a baseball on one side of his face. “Renouncing” the biocratic management of his health, Illich insisted on the “hygienic autonomy” of self-care and “the right to die without diagnosis.” When the pain was too great during the final phase of his life, he would seek relief by standing on his head against a wall or by smoking opium in a little pipe he carried around with him.<br>In his more obscure and less public observations, Illich saw the Catholic Church’s depersonalized “kindness of strangers” as a corruption of the Christian act of charity institutionalized as a kind of inauthentic paternalism. In his book, Cayley suggests that Illich’s broad critique of the institutions of Western modernity were metaphors for an attack on the Catholic Church’s perversion of the personal experience of incarnation he was unwilling to make frontally, a kind of hidden theology that threaded through all his work. To the extent this errant pilgrim’s critique of the splintering and shattering of the oneness of Life can be considered theology, it is not so much hidden as constitutive of all Illich’s thinking.&nbsp;<br>One does not have to embrace Illich’s romanticization of premodern times to grasp his relevance for the future headed our way. We appear to be entering a new pivotal age in which the modern certitudes he so thoroughly questioned are near exhaustion, finally opening the social imagination to the kind of fundamental reconsideration that seemed so radical in Illich’s day, but no longer do.]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/Ivan Illich.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/The Church/Theologians/Ivan Illich.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 02:15:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peter Maurin]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>A Selection of Peter Maurin's Easy Essays<br>Blowing the Dynamite<br>Writing about the Catholic Church,<br>
a radical writer says:<br>
“Rome will have to do more<br>
than to play a waiting game;<br>
she will have to use<br>
some of the dynamite<br>
inherent in her message.”<br>
To blow the dynamite<br>
of a message<br>
is the only way<br>
to make the message dynamic.<br>
If the Catholic Church<br>
is not today<br>
the dominant social dynamic force,<br>
it is because Catholic scholars<br>
have failed to blow the dynamite<br>
of the Church.<br>
Catholic scholars<br>
have taken the dynamite<br>
of the Church,<br>
have wrapped it up<br>
in nice phraseology,<br>
placed it in an hermetic container<br>
and sat on the lid.<br>
It is about time<br>
to blow the lid off<br>
so the Catholic Church<br>
may again become<br>
the dominant social dynamic force.<br>No Recourse<br>
<br>
Politicians used to say:<br>
"We make prosperity<br>
through our wise policies."

<br>
Business men used to say:<br>
"We make prosperity<br>
through our private enterprise."

<br>
The workers did not have anything to say<br>
about the matter;

<br>
They were either put to work<br>
or thrown out of employment

<br>
And when unemployment came<br>
the workers<br>
had no recourse<br>
against the professed makers<br>
of prosperity,<br>
politicians and business men.

<br>Politics Is Politics<br>
<br>
A politician is an artist<br>
in the art of following the wind<br>
of  public opinion.

<br>
He who follows the wind<br>
of public opinion<br>
does not follow<br>
his own judgement.

<br>
And he who does not follow<br>
his own judgement<br>
cannot lead people<br>
out of the beaten path.

<br>
He is like the tail of a dog<br>
that tries to lead the head.

<br>
When people stand behind their president<br>
and their president<br>
stands behind them<br>
they and their president<br>
go around in a circle<br>
getting nowhere.

<br>Classes And Clashes<br>
<br>
Business men say<br>
that because everybody is selfish<br>
business must necessarily<br>
be based on selfishness.

<br>
But when business<br>
is based on selfishness<br>
everbody is busy<br>
becoming more selfish.

<br>
And when everybody is busy<br>
becoming more selfish,<br>
you have classes and clashes.

<br>
Business men create problems;<br>
they do not solve them.

<br>Teachers Of Subjects<br>
<br>
Our business managers<br>
don't know how to manage<br>
the things they try to manage,<br>
because they don't understand<br>
the things they try to manage.

<br>
So they turn to college professors<br>
in the hope of understanding<br>
the things they try to manage.

<br>
But college professors<br>
do not profess anything,<br>
they only teach subjects.

<br>
As teachers of subjects,<br>
college professors<br>
may enable people<br>
to master subjects,<br>
but mastering subjects<br>
has never enabled anyone<br>
to master situations.

<br>The Age Of Treason<br>
<br>
Pope Pius IX and Cardinal Newman<br>
consider liberalism,<br>
whether it be<br>
religious, philosophical, or economic,<br>
the greatest error of the nineteenth century.

<br>
Modern liberalism<br>
is the logical sequence<br>
of the so-called age of Enlightenment-<br>
the age of Voltaire, Rousseau, Thomas Paine-<br>
sometimes called the Age of Reason<br>
in opposition to the Age of Faith.

<br>
By sponsoring nationalism and capitalism<br>
modern liberals<br>
have given up the search for truth<br>
and have become paid propagandists.

<br>
Modern liberals have ceased to appeal to reason,<br>
and have chosen to appeal to prejudice.

<br>
So the Age of Reason<br>
has become the age of Treason,<br>
as Julien Benda points out<br>
in his book entitled:<br>
"The treason of the Intellectuals".

<br>Church And State<br>
<br>
Modern Society<br>
believes in the separation<br>
of Church and State.

<br>
But the Jews<br>
did not believe in it.

<br>
The Greeks<br>
did not believe in it.

<br>
The Romans<br>
did not believe in it.

<br>
The Mediaevals<br>
did not believe in it.

<br>
The Puritians<br>
did not believe in it.

<br>
Modern society<br>
has separated Church and State<br>
but it did not separate the State<br>
from business.

<br>
The State is no longer<br>
a Church's State.

<br>
The State is now<br>
a Business Men's State.

<br>Getting Stuck<br>
<br>
Ethical teachers seem to wish<br>
every worker to be a stockholder<br>
and every stockhoulder to be a worker.

<br>
As a stockholder<br>
the worker wants bigger dividends.

<br>
As a worker<br>
he wants bigger wages.

<br>
And the stock promoters<br>
stock him with stocks<br>
till he gets stuck.

<br>
And labor organizers<br>
promise him better conditions<br>
and exact bigger dues.

<br>
And the worker<br>
finds himself exploited<br>
both by stock promoters<br>
and labor organizers.

<br>A Modern Pest<br>
<br>
"What ails modern society<br>
is separation<br>
of the spiritual<br>
from the material",<br>
says Glenn Frank.

<br>
"Secularism is a pest",<br>
says Pius XI.

<br>
When religion<br>
has nothing to do<br>
with education,<br>
education,<br>
education is only<br>
information;<br>
plenty of facts,<br>
but no understanding.

<br>
When religion<br>
has nothing to do<br>
with politics,<br>
politics is only<br>
factionalism:<br>
"Let's turn the rascals out<br>
so our good friends<br>
can get in."

<br>
When religion<br>
has nothing to do<br>
with business,<br>
business is only<br>
commercialism:<br>
"Let's get what we can<br>
while the getting is good."

<br>Shouting With Rotarians<br>
<br>
The modern man looks for thought<br>
so that he can have light,<br>
and he is unable to find it<br>
in our modern schools.

<br>
According to Professor Meiklejohn,<br>
"Students go school<br>
not to be directed<br>
but to become business men."

<br>
According to Glenn Frank,<br>
President of the University of Wisconsin,<br>
"Schools reflect the environment,<br>
they do not create it."

<br>
Which explains why<br>
shortly after their graduation,<br>
school graduates could be heard<br>
shouting with Rotarians:<br>
"Service for profits",<br>
"Time is money",<br>
"Keep Smiling",<br>
"Business is business",<br>
"How are you making out?"<br>
"The law of supply and demand",<br>
"Competition is the life of trade",<br>
"Your dollar is your best friend".

<br><a class="internal-link" data-href="Catholic Worker.md" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Voluntary Organizations/Catholic Worker.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Catholic Worker</a> Philosophy<br>
Christianity Untried<br>
<br>Chesterton says:<br>
"The Christian ideal<br>
has not been tried<br>
and found wanting.
<br>It has been found difficult<br>
and left untried."
<br>Christianity has not been tried<br>
because people thought<br>
it was impractical.
<br>And men have tried everything<br>
except Christianity.
<br>And everything<br>
that men have tried<br>
has failed.
<br>The Duty of Hospitality<br>
<br>People who are in need<br>
and are not afraid to beg<br>
give to people not in need<br>
the occasion to do good<br>
for goodness'sake.
<br>Modern society calls the beggar<br>
bum and panhandler<br>
and gives him the bum's rush.<br>
But the Greeks used to say<br>
that people in need<br>
are the ambassadors of the gods.
<br>Although you may be called<br>
bums and panhandlers<br>
you are in fact<br>
the Ambassadors of God.
<br>As God's Ambassadors<br>
you should be given food,<br>
clothing and shelter<br>
by those who are able to give it.
<br>Mahometan teachers tell us<br>
that God commands hospitality,<br>
and hospitality is still practiced<br>
in Mahometan countries.
<br>But the duty of hospitality<br>
is neither taught nor practiced<br>
in Christian countries.
<br>Feeding the Poor at a Sacrifice<br>
<br>In the first centuries<br>
of Christianity<br>
the hungry were fed<br>
at a personal sacrifice,<br>
the naked were clothed<br>
at a personal sacrifice,<br>
the homeless were sheltered<br>
at personal sacrifice.
<br>And because the poor<br>
were fed, clothed and sheltered<br>
at a personal sacrifice,<br>
the pagans used to say<br>
about the Christians<br>
"See how they love each other."
<br>In our own day<br>
the poor are no longer<br>
fed, clothed, sheltered<br>
at a personal sacrifice,<br>
but at the expense<br>
of the taxpayers.
<br>And because the poor<br>
are no longer<br>
fed, clothed and sheltered<br>
the pagans say about the Christians<br>
"See how they pass the buck."
<br>A Radical Change<br>
<br>The order of the day<br>
is to talk about the social order. 
<br>Conservatives would like<br>
to keep it from changing<br>
but they don't know how.
<br>Liberals try to patch it<br>
and call it a New Deal.
<br>Socialists want a change,<br>
but a gradual change.
<br>Communists want a change,<br>
an immediate change,<br>
but a Socialist change.
<br>Communists in Russia<br>
do not build Communism,<br>
they build Socialism.
<br>Communists want to pass<br>
from capitalism to Socialism<br>
and from Socialism to Communism.
<br>I want a change,<br>
and a radical change.
<br>I want a change<br>
from an acquisitive society<br>
to a functional society,<br>
from a society of go-getters<br>
to a society of go-givers.
<br>Historical Background<br>
Thirteenth-Century France<br>
<br>
Henry Adams, who had in his ancestry<br>
two Presidents of the United States,<br>
says in his autobiography<br>
that one cannot get an education<br>
in modern America.

<br>
And the reason he gives is,<br>
that there is<br>
no unity of thought<br>
in modern America.

<br>
So he went to England<br>
and found that modern England<br>
is too much like America.

<br>
So he went to France<br>
and found that modern France<br>
is too much like England and America.

<br>
But in France, Henry Adams found<br>
that one could get an education<br>
in thirteenth-century France.

<br>
And he wrote a book concerning<br>
the Cathedral of Chartes<br>
and the Mount Saint-Michel,<br>
where he points out<br>
that there was unity of thought<br>
in thirteenth-century France.

<br>Guild System – 1200 A.D.<br>
<br>
In 1200 A.D.<br>
there was no Capitalist System,<br>
there was the Guild System.

<br>
The doctrine of the Guilds<br>
was the doctrine<br>
of the Common Good.

<br>
The people used to say<br>
as they do now:<br>
"What can I do for you?"<br>
but they meant what they said.

<br>
Now they say one thing<br>
and they mean another.

<br>
They did not look for markets,<br>
they let markets<br>
look for them.

<br>Roman Law – 1300 A.D.<br>
<br>
In 1300 A.D.<br>
the Roman Law<br>
took place<br>
of the Canon Law.

<br>
The Roman Law<br>
enables rich men<br>
to live among the poor men.

<br>
The Canon Law<br>
enables good men<br>
to live among bad men.

<br>
"Divide to rule"<br>
became the slogan<br>
of the politicians.

<br>
In his book "The Prince",<br>
Machiavelli<br>
taught them how.

<br>
So politics<br>
ceased to be policy<br>
and became<br>
just politics.

<br>Middle-Man – 1400 A.D.<br>
<br>
Around 1400 A.D.<br>
appears the middle-man.

<br>
He offers to buy the goods<br>
and to find a market.

<br>
The guild's man<br>
thinks about the money<br>
offered for his goods<br>
and forgets the Common Good.

<br>
And the middle-man<br>
is not interested<br>
in selling useful goods<br>
but in making money<br>
on any kind of goods.

<br>
And the consumer<br>
never meets the producer<br>
and the producer<br>
ceases to think<br>
in terms of service<br>
and begins to think<br>
in terms of profits.

<br>Calvinism – 1530 A.D.<br>
<br>
American Puritanism<br>
was to a great extent<br>
an outgrowth of Calvinism.

<br>
Andre' Siegfried says:<br>
"The Puritan<br>
is proud to be rich.

<br>
"If he makes money,<br>
he likes to tell himself<br>
that Divine Providence<br>
sends it to him.

<br>
"His wealth itself<br>
becomes in his eyes<br>
as well as the eyes of others<br>
a mark of God's blessing.

<br>
"A time comes<br>
when he no longer knows<br>
if he acts for duty's sake<br>
or for interest's sake.

<br>
"It becomes difficult<br>
in those conditions<br>
to make a demarcation<br>
between religious aspiration<br>
and the pursuit of wealth."

<br>Banker – 1600 A.D.<br>
<br>
Before John Calvin<br>
people were not allowed<br>
to lend money at interest.

<br>
John Calvin decided<br>
to legalize<br>
money-lending at interest<br>
in spite of the teachings<br>
of the Prophets of Israel<br>
and the Fathers of the Church.

<br>
Protestant countries<br>
tried to keep up with John Calvin<br>
and money-lending at interest<br>
became the general practice.

<br>
And money ceased to be<br>
a means of exchange<br>
and began to be<br>
a means to make money.

<br>
So people lent money on time<br>
and started to think of time<br>
in terms of money<br>
and said to each other:<br>
"Time is money."

<br>Manufacturer – 1700 A.D.<br>
<br>
With the discovery of steam<br>
the factory system<br>
made its appearance.

<br>
To take drudgery out of the home<br>
was suppose to be<br>
the aim of the manufacturer.

<br>
So the guildsman<br>
left his shop<br>
and went to the factory.

<br>
But the profit-making manufacturer<br>
found it more profitable<br>
to employ women<br>
than to employ men.

<br>
So the women left the home<br>
and went to the factory.

<br>
Soon the children<br>
followed the women<br>
into the factory.

<br>
So the men have to stay at home<br>
while women and children<br>
work in the factory.

<br>Economist – 1800 A.D.<br>
<br>
The Laissez-Faire Economists<br>
told everybody<br>
that competition<br>
is the life of trade<br>
and that it is a case<br>
of survival of the fittest.

<br>
So since 1800<br>
looking for markets<br>
has engaged men's activities.

<br>
And since trade follows the flag<br>
industral nations<br>
have also become<br>
imperialst nations.

<br>
The fight for markets<br>
between two industrial nations,<br>
England and Germany,<br>
was the main cause<br>
of the World War.

<br>World War – 1914<br>
<br>
As President Wilson said,<br>
the World War<br>
was a commercial war.

<br>
But a commercial war<br>
had to be idealized,<br>
so it was called<br>
a War for Democracy.

<br>
But the War for Democracy<br>
did not bring Democracy:<br>
it brought<br>
Bolshevism in Russia,<br>
Fascism in Italy,<br>
Nazism in Germany.

<br>World Depression – 1929<br>
<br>
After the World War<br>
people tried to believe<br>
that a New Era<br>
had dawned upon the world.

<br>
People thought<br>
that they had found a solution<br>
to the problem<br>
of mass-distribution.

<br>
People thought<br>
that the time had come<br>
for the two-car garage,<br>
a chicken in every pot,<br>
and a sign "To Let"<br>
in front of every poor-house.

<br>
And everybody<br>
wanted to cash in<br>
on the future prosperity.

<br>
So stock promoters got busy<br>
and stocked people with stocks<br>
till they got stuck.

<br>Legalized Usury<br>
God And Mammon<br>
<br>
Christ says: "The dollar you have<br>
is the dollar you give."

<br>
The Banker says: "The dollar you have<br>
is the dollar you keep."

<br>
Christ says: "You cannot serve two masters,<br>
God and Mammom."

<br>
"'You cannot.' And all our education consists<br>
in trying to find out how we can,"<br>
says Robert Louis Stevenson.

<br>
"The poor are the true children of the Church",<br>
says Bossuet.

<br>
"Modern society<br>
has made the bank account<br>
the standard of values",<br>
says Charles Peguy.

<br>Usurers Are Not Gentlemen<br>
<br>
The Prophets of Israel<br>
and the Fathers of the Church<br>
forbade lending money at interest.

<br>
Lending at interest<br>
was called usury<br>
by the Prophets of Israel<br>
and the Fathers of the Church.

<br>
Usurers were not considered<br>
to be gentlemen<br>
when people used to listen<br>
to the Prophets of Israel<br>
and the Fathers of the Church.

<br>
When people used to listen<br>
to the Prophets of Israel<br>
and the Fathers of the Church<br>
they could not see anything gentle<br>
in trying to live<br>
on the sweat of somebody else's brow<br>
by lending money at interest.

<br>Wealth-Producing Maniacs<br>
<br>
When John Calvin<br>
legalized money-lending at interest,<br>
he made the bank account<br>
the standard of values.

<br>
When the bank account<br>
became the standard of values,<br>
people ceased to produce for use<br>
and began to produce for profits.

<br>
When people began to produce for profits<br>
they became<br>
wealth-producing maniacs.

<br>
When people became wealth-producing maniacs<br>
they produced too much wealth.

<br>
When people found out<br>
that they had produced too much wealth<br>
they went on an orgy<br>
of wealth-destruction<br>
and destroyed<br>
ten million lives besides.

<br>Mortgaged<br>
<br>
Because John Calvin<br>
legalized money-lending at interest,<br>
the State has legalized<br>
money-lending at interest.

<br>
Because the State has legalized<br>
money-lending at interest,<br>
home owners<br>
have mortgaged their farms;<br>
institutions<br>
have mortgaged their buildings;<br>
congregations<br>
have mortgaged their churches;<br>
cities, counties, States<br>
and Federal Government<br>
have mortgaged their budgets.

<br>
So people find themselves<br>
in all kinds of financial difficulties<br>
because the State<br>
has legalized money-lending at interest<br>
in spite of the teachings<br>
of the Prophets of Israel<br>
and the Fathers of the Church.

<br>The Fallacy Of Saving<br>
<br>
When people save money<br>
that means money is invested.

<br>
Money invested<br>
increases production.

<br>
Increased production<br>
brings a surplus in production.

<br>
A surplus in production<br>
brings unemployment.

<br>
Unemployment<br>
brings a slump in business.

<br>
A slump in business<br>
brings more unemployment.

<br>
More unemployment<br>
brings a depression.

<br>
A depression<br>
brings more depression.

<br>
More depression<br>
brings red agitation.

<br>
Red agitation<br>
brings red revolution.

<br>Avoiding Inflation<br>
<br>
Some say<br>
that inflation is desirable.

<br>
Some say<br>
that inflation is deplorable.

<br>
Some say<br>
that inflation is deplorable<br>
but inevitable.

<br>
The way to avoid inflation<br>
is to lighten the burden<br>
of money-borrowers<br>
without robbing the money-lenders.

<br>
And the way<br>
to lighten the burden<br>
of money-borrowers<br>
with robbing the money-lenders<br>
is to pass two laws:<br>
one law making immediately illegal<br>
all interest on money lent<br>
and another law<br>
obligating the money-borrowers<br>
to pay one per cent of the debt<br>
every year<br>
during a period<br>
of a hundred years.

<br>Works of Mercy<br>
The Wisdom Of Giving<br>
<br>
To give to the poor<br>
is to enable the poor to buy.

<br>
To enable the poor to buy<br>
is to improve the market.

<br>
To improve the market<br>
is to help business.

<br>
To help business<br>
is to reduce unemployment.

<br>
To reduce unnemployment<br>
is to reduce crime.

<br>
To reduce crime<br>
is to reduce taxation.

<br>
So why not give to the poor<br>
for business' sake,<br>
for humanity's sake,<br>
for God's sake?

<br>Share Your Wealth<br>
<br>
God wants us<br>
to be our brother's keeper.

<br>
To feed the hungry,<br>
to clothe the naked,<br>
to shelter the homeless,<br>
to instruct the ignorant,<br>
at a personal sacrifice,<br>
is what God<br>
wants us to do.

<br>
What we give to the poor<br>
for Christ's sake<br>
is what we carry with us<br>
when we die.

<br>
As Jean-Jacques Rousseau say:<br>
"When man dies<br>
he carries<br>
in his clutches hands<br>
only that which<br>
he has given away."

<br>Why Not Be A Beggar?<br>
<br>
People who are in need<br>
and are not afraid to beg<br>
give to people not in need<br>
the occasion to do good<br>
for goodness' sake.

<br>
Modern society<br>
calls the beggar<br>
bum and panhandler<br>
and gives him the bum's rush.

<br>
The Greeks used to say<br>
that people in need<br>
are the ambassadors of the gods.

<br>
We read in the Gospel:<br>
"As long as you did it<br>
to one of the least<br>
of My brothers<br>
you did it to Me."

<br>
While modern society<br>
calls the beggars<br>
bums and panhandlers,<br>
they are in fact<br>
the Ambassadors of God.

<br>
To be God's Ambassador<br>
is something<br>
to be proud of.

<br>Municipal Lodgings<br>
<br>
People who are in need<br>
are not invited<br>
to spend the night<br>
in homes of the rich.

<br>
There are guest rooms<br>
in the homes of the rich<br>
but they are not<br>
for those who need them.

<br>
They are not<br>
for those who need them<br>
because those who need them<br>
are no longer considered<br>
as the Ambassadors of God.

<br>
So the duty of hospitality<br>
is no longer considered<br>
as a personal duty.

<br>
So people without a home<br>
are sent to the city<br>
where hospitality is given<br>
at the taxpayer's expense.

<br>Bishop-Shy<br>
<br>
The Holy Father<br>
appoints a man<br>
named a Bishop<br>
to a seat - a cathedra.

<br>
From that seat - cathedra<br>
the Bishop<br>
teaches the truth<br>
to all men<br>
so the truth<br>
may make them free.

<br>
But some people<br>
are Bishop-shy.

<br>
They are Bishop-shy<br>
because they are<br>
hungry, shivering, or sleepy.

<br>
They must be<br>
fed, clothed, and sheltered<br>
before they will consent<br>
to come to listen<br>
to Christ's Bishop.

<br>
To feed, clothe, and shelter them<br>
at a personal sacrifice<br>
is to participate<br>
in the Bishop's apostolate.

<br>Passing The Buck<br>
<br>
In the first centuries of Christianity<br>
the poor were fed, clothed, and sheltered<br>
at a personal sacrifice<br>
and the Pagans<br>
said about the Christians:<br>
"See how they love each other."

<br>
Today the poor are fed, clothed, and sheltered<br>
by the politicians<br>
at the expense<br>
of the taxpayers.

<br>
And because the poor<br>
are no longer<br>
fed, clothed, and sheltered<br>
at a personal sacrifice<br>
but at the expense<br>
of taxpayers<br>
Pagans say about Christians:<br>
"See how they pass the buck."

<br>Hospices<br>
<br>
We read in the Catholic Encyclopedia<br>
that during the early ages<br>
of Christianity<br>
the Hospices<br>
or Houses of Hospitality<br>
was a shelter<br>
for the sick, the poor,<br>
the orphan, the old, the traveller,<br>
and the needy of every kind.

<br>
Originally the Hospices<br>
of Houses of Hospitality<br>
were under the supervision<br>
of the Bishops<br>
who designated priests<br>
to administer<br>
the spiritual<br>
and temporal affairs<br>
of these charitable institutions.

<br>Houses Of Hospitality<br>
<br>
We need Houses of Hospitality<br>
to give to the rich<br>
the opportunity<br>
to serve the poor.

<br>
We need Houses of Hospitality<br>
to bring the scholars<br>
to the workers<br>
or the workers<br>
to the scholars.

<br>
We need Houses of Hospitality<br>
to bring back to institutions<br>
the technique to institutions.

<br>
We need Houses of Hospitality<br>
to show<br>
what idealism looks like<br>
when it is practiced.

<br>Servants Of The Poor<br>
<br>
In seventeenth-century France<br>
there was a priest<br>
by the name of Vincent.

<br>
Father Vincent realized<br>
that the country<br>
was going to the dogs.

<br>
When something goes wrong<br>
they say in France:<br>
"Cherchez la femme-<br>
look for the woman."

<br>
Looking for the woman<br>
Father Vincent found out<br>
that many woman<br>
were trying to be<br>
the mistresses of the rich.

<br>
St. Vincent of Paul<br>
gathered several women<br>
and told them:<br>
"If you want<br>
to put the country on its feet<br>
refuse to be<br>
the mistress of the rich<br>
and choose to be<br>
the servants of the poor."

<br>Scholars And Workers<br>
<br>
By living with the workers<br>
in Houses of Hospitality<br>
scholars will be able<br>
to convey to the workers<br>
why things are<br>
what they are,<br>
how things would be<br>
if they were as they should be,<br>
and how a path can be made<br>
from things as they are<br>
to things as they should be.

<br>
By living with the workers<br>
in Houses of Hospitality<br>
scholars will be able<br>
to win the workers' sympathy,<br>
and therefore<br>
keep the workers<br>
from being influenced<br>
by selfish demagogues.

<br>
By living with the workers<br>
in Houses of Hospitality<br>
ascholars will be able<br>
to become dynamic<br>
and therefore<br>
be the driving force<br>
of a new social order.

<br>Social Workers and Workers<br>
<br>
The training of social workers<br>
enables them to help people<br>
to adjust themselves<br>
to the existing environment.

<br>
The training of social workers<br>
does not enable them<br>
to help people<br>
to change the environment.

<br>
Social workers<br>
must become social minded<br>
before they can be<br>
critics of the existing environment<br>
and free creative agents<br>
of the new environment.

<br>
In the Houses of Hospitality<br>
social workers can aquire<br>
the art of human contacts<br>
and the social-mindedness<br>
or understanding of social forces<br>
which will make them<br>
critical of the existing environment<br>
and free creative agents<br>
of a new environment.

<br>Rich And Poor<br>
<br>
Afraid of the poor<br>
who don't like to get poorer,<br>
the rich who like to get richer<br>
turn to the State for protection.

<br>
But the State is not only<br>
the State of the rich<br>
it is also the State of the poor<br>
who don't like to get poorer.

<br>
So the State sometimes chooses to help<br>
the many poor<br>
who don't like to get poorer,<br>
at the expense of the few rich<br>
who like to get richer.

<br>
Dissatisfied with the State,<br>
the rich who like to get richer<br>
turn to the Church<br>
to save them from the poor<br>
who don't like to get poorer.

<br>
But the Church can only tell the rich<br>
who like to get richer:<br>
"Woe to you rich<br>
who like to get richer,<br>
if you don't help the poor<br>
who don't like to get poorer."

<br>Criticism and Marxism<br>
Not Communists<br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong<br>
with Communism,<br>
but there is something wrong<br>
with Communists.

<br>
The wrong thing with Communists is<br>
that they are not Communists,<br>
they are Socialists.

<br>
There is no Communism<br>
in Soviet Russia,<br>
there is State Socialism<br>
in Soviet Russia.

<br>
The State has not withered away,<br>
the wage system still prevails,<br>
and they are selling<br>
7% government bonds<br>
in Soviet Russia.

<br>
By selling 7% government bonds<br>
they are creating<br>
a new parasitic class<br>
in Socialist Russia.

<br>Taking Over<br>
<br>
The aim of the Communists<br>
is to take over the control<br>
of the means of production<br>
and distribution.

<br>
The means of production<br>
and distribution<br>
are now in the hands<br>
of Capitalists.

<br>
The class war is a war<br>
between Communists<br>
and Capitalists<br>
over control<br>
of the means of production<br>
and distribution.

<br>
Patriots believe<br>
that the way to bring about<br>
a classless society<br>
is a class war<br>
between the Capitalist State<br>
and the working class.

<br>What Is Communism?<br>
<br>
Communists believe<br>
in capturing the State<br>
so as to be able<br>
to use it as a club<br>
to prevent anybody<br>
from becoming a Capitalist.

<br>
The Communist manifesto<br>
defines Communism<br>
as "a state of society"<br>
where each one works<br>
according to his ability<br>
and gets<br>
according to his needs."

<br>
Using the power of the State<br>
will enable Communists<br>
to prevent anybody<br>
from becoming<br>
a successful Capitalist<br>
but it will not<br>
make anybody<br>
Communist at heart.

<br>
To be a Communist<br>
according to the definition<br>
of the Communist Manifesto<br>
is to be willing to give one's labor<br>
for the benefit<br>
of a Communist Community.

<br>I Agree<br>
<br>
I agree with seven Bishops,<br>
three of whom are Archbishops,<br>
that the Communist criticism<br>
of the rugged individualism<br>
of bourgeois capitalism<br>
is a sound criticism.

<br>
I agree with seven Bishops,<br>
three of whom are Archbishops,<br>
that the main social aim<br>
of the communist Party<br>
is a sound social aim.

<br>
I agree with seven Bishops,<br>
three whom are Archbishops,<br>
that the Communists are not sound<br>
when they advocate class struggle<br>
and proletarian dictatorship<br>
as the best practical means<br>
to realize their sound social aim.

<br>To Be A Marxist<br>
<br>
Before he died<br>
Karl Marx told one of his friends:<br>
"I have lived long enough<br>
to be able to say<br>
that i am not a Marxist."

<br>
To be a Marxist,<br>
according to the logic of Das Kapital,<br>
is to maintain<br>
that the best thing to do<br>
is to wait patiently<br>
till Capitalism<br>
has fulfilled its historic mission.

<br>
To be a Marxist<br>
according to the logic of Das Kapital,<br>
is to step back,<br>
take and academic view of things,<br>
and watch the self-satisfied Capitalists<br>
dig their own graves.

<br>
To be a Marxist,<br>
according to the logic of Das Kapital,<br>
is to let economic evolution<br>
do its work<br>
without ever attempting<br>
to give it a push.

<br>Karl Marx Soon Realized<br>
<br>
Karl Marx soon realized<br>
that his own analysis<br>
of bourgeois society<br>
could not be the basis<br>
of a dynamic revolutionary movement.

<br>
karl Marx soon realized<br>
that a forceful Communist Manifesto<br>
was the necessary foundation<br>
of a dynamic Communist Movement.

<br>
Karl Marx soon realized,<br>
as Lenin realized,<br>
that there is no revolution<br>
without revolutionary action;<br>
that there is no revolutionary action<br>
without a revolutionary movement;<br>
that there is no revolutionary movement<br>
without a vanguard of revolution<br>
and that there is no vanguard of revolution<br>
without a theory of revolution.

<br>The Communist Manifesto<br>
<br>
Having realized<br>
that a Communist Manifesto<br>
was the basis of a Communist Movement,<br>
Karl Marx decided<br>
to write a Communist Manifesto.

<br>
To write the Communist Manifesto<br>
Karl marx did not use<br>
his own analysis of Capitalism.

<br>
He took the criticism<br>
of the bourgeois society of his time<br>
by Victor Considerant<br>
and made it the first part<br>
of the Communist Manifesto.

<br>
He took the definition of Communism<br>
by Proudhon<br>
and made it his own.

<br>
He tried to make himself believe<br>
that class struggle was the first step<br>
from a Capitalist society<br>
where man is inhuman to man<br>
to a Communist society<br>
where man in human to man.

<br>Communitarianism<br>
Five Definitions<br>1.A Bourgeois<br>
is a fellow who tries to be somebody<br>
by trying to be<br>
like everybody,<br>
which makes him<br>
a nobody.<br>
<br>
A Dictator<br>
is a fellow<br>
who does not hesitate<br>
to strike you over the head<br>
if you refuse to do<br>
what he waants you to do.

<br>
A Leader<br>
is a fellow<br>
who refuses to be crazy<br>
the way everybody else is crazy<br>
and tries to be crazy<br>
in his own crazy way.

<br>
A Bolshevist<br>
is a fellow<br>
who tries to get<br>
what the other fellow has<br>
and to regulate<br>
what you should have.

<br>
A Communitarian<br>
is a fellow<br>
who refuses to be<br>
what the other fellow is<br>
and tries to be<br>
what he wants him to be.

<br>They And We<br>
<br>
People say:<br>
"They don't do this,<br>
they don't do that,<br>
they ought to do this,<br>
this ought to do that."

<br>
Always "They"<br>
and never "I".

<br>3.People should say:<br>
"They are crazy<br>
for doing this<br>
and not doing that<br>
but I don't need<br>
to be crazy<br>
the way they are crazy."<br>
<br>
The Communitarian Revolution<br>
is basically<br>
a personal revolution.

<br>
It starts with I<br>
not with They.

<br>
One I plus one I<br>
makes two I<br>
and two I makes We.

<br>
"We" is a community<br>
while "they" is a crowd.

<br>Communitarian Movement<br>
<br>
The Nazis, the Fascists,<br>
and the Bolshevists<br>
are Totalitarians.

<br>
The Catholic Worker<br>
is Communitarian.

<br>
The principles of Communitarianism<br>
are expounded every month<br>
in the French magazine<br>
Esprit (The Spirit).

<br>
Emmanuel Mounier,<br>
editor of the magizine,<br>
has a book entitled,<br>
"La revolution personnaliste<br>
et communitaire."

<br>
Raymond de Becker<br>
is the leader in Belgium<br>
of the Communitarian Movement

<br>
Dr. Kagawa<br>
the Japanese co-operator<br>
is truly imbued<br>
with the communitarian spirit.

<br>The C.P. And C.M.<br>
<br>
The Communist Party<br>
credits bourgeois capitalism<br>
with an historic mission.

<br>
The Communitarian Movement<br>
condemns it<br>
on general principles.

<br>
The Communist Party<br>
throws the monkey-wrench<br>
of class struggle<br>
into the economic machinery<br>
and by doing so<br>
delays the fulfilling<br>
of the historic mission<br>
which it credits<br>
to capitalism.

<br>
The Communitarian Movement<br>
aims to create<br>
a new society<br>
within the shell of the old<br>
with the philosophy of the new<br>
which is not<br>
a new philosophy<br>
but a very old philosophy,<br>
a philosophy so old<br>
that it looks like new.

<br>
The Communist Party<br>
stands for proletarian dictatorship.

<br>
The Communitarian Movement<br>
stands for personalist leadership.

<br>What Labor Needs<br>
<br>
A Communist Community<br>
is a Community<br>
with a common unity.

<br>
A common belief<br>
is what makes the unity<br>
if a community.

<br>
Norman Thomas says<br>
that "Ramsay MacDonald<br>
has failed to give to Labor<br>
a philosophy of labor".

<br>
What labor needs<br>
is not economic security.

<br>
What Labor needs<br>
is a philosophy of labor.

<br>Three Ways To Make A Living<br>
<br>
Mirabeau says:<br>
"There are only three ways<br>
to make a living:<br>
Stealing, begging, working."

<br>
Stealing is against the law of God<br>
and against the law of men.

<br>
Begging is against the law of men,<br>
but not against the law of God.

<br>
Working is neither against the law of God<br>
nor against the law of men.

<br>
But they say<br>
that there is no work to do.

<br>
There is plenty of work to do,<br>
but no wages.

<br>
But people do not need<br>
to work for wages.

<br>
They can offer their services<br>
as a gift.

<br>Capital And Labor<br>
<br>
"Capital", says Karl Marx,<br>
"is accumulated labor,<br>
not for the benefit of the laborers,<br>
but for the benefit of the accumulators."

<br>
And Capitalists succeed<br>
in accumulating labor<br>
by treating labor<br>
not as a gift,<br>
but as a commodity,<br>
buying it as any other commodity<br>
at the lowest possible price.

<br>
And organized labor<br>
plays into the hands<br>
of the capitalists<br>
or accumulators of labor<br>
by treating their own labor<br>
not as a gift,<br>
but as a commodity,<br>
selling it as any other commodity<br>
at the highest possible price.

<br>Selling their Labor<br>
<br>
And when the capitalists<br>
or accumulators of labor<br>
have accumulated so much<br>
of the laborer's labor<br>
that they no longer<br>
find it profitable<br>
to buy the labor's labor<br>
then the laborers<br>
can no longer<br>
sell their labor<br>
to the capitalists<br>
or accumulators of labor.

<br>
And when the laborers<br>
can no longer<br>
sell their labor<br>
to the capitalists<br>
or accumulators of labor,<br>
they can no longer buy<br>
the products of their labor.

<br>
And that is<br>
what the laborers get<br>
for selling their labor<br>
to the capitalists<br>
or accumulators of labor.

<br>What Makes Man Human<br>
<br>To give and not to take<br>
that is what makes man human.
<br>To serve and not to rule<br>
that is what makes man human.
<br>To help and not to crush<br>
that is what makes man human.
<br>To nourish and not to devour<br>
that is what makes man human.
<br>And if need be<br>
to die and not to live<br>
that is what makes man human.
<br>Ideals and not deals<br>
that is what makes man human.
<br>Creed and not greed<br>
that is what makes man human.
<br>Better Or Better Off<br>
<br>
The world would be better off,<br>
if people tried<br>
to become better.

<br>
And people would<br>
become better<br>
if they stopped trying<br>
to be better off.

<br>
For when everybody tries<br>
to become better off,<br>
nobody is better off.

<br>
But when everybody tries<br>
to become better,<br>
everybody is better off.

<br>
Everybody would be rich<br>
if nobody tried<br>
to be richer.

<br>
And nobody would be poor<br>
if everybody tried<br>
to be the poorest.

<br>
And everybody would be<br>
what he ought to be<br>
if everybody tried to be<br>
what he wants<br>
the other fellow to be.

<br>Big Shots And Little Shots<br>
<br>
When the big shots<br>
become bigger shots<br>
then the little shots<br>
become littler shots.

<br>
And when the little shots<br>
become littler shots<br>
because the big shots<br>
become bigger shots<br>
then the little shots<br>
get mad at the big shots.

<br>
And when the little shots<br>
get mad at the big shots<br>
because the big shots<br>
by becomming bigger shots<br>
make the little shots<br>
littler shots<br>
they shoot the big shots<br>
full of little shots.

<br>
But by shooting the big shots<br>
full of little shots<br>
the little shots<br>
do not become big shots,<br>
they make everything all shot.

<br>Christianity, Capitalism, Communism<br>
<br>
Christianity has nothing to do<br>
with either modern Capitalism<br>
or modern Communism,<br>
for Christianity<br>
has a Capitalism of its own,<br>
and a Communism of its own.

<br>
Modern Capitalism<br>
is based on property<br>
without responsibility,<br>
while Christian Capitalism<br>
is based on property<br>
with responsibility.

<br>
Modern Communism<br>
is based on poverty through force,<br>
while Christian Communism<br>
is based on poverty through choice.

<br>
For a Christian,<br>
voluntary poverty is the ideal<br>
as exemplified by Saint Francis of Assisi,<br>
while privte property<br>
is not an absolute right,<br>
but a trust,<br>
which must be administered<br>
for the benefit of God's children.

<br>Looking At Property<br>Fr. Henry Carr, Superior of the Basilians, says:<br>
<br>
Socialists and Communists<br>
battle against<br>
the unequal conditions<br>
of the poor.

<br>
Presumably they would be satisfied<br>
if all were on a level.

<br>
Do you not see<br>
that this does not touch<br>
the question that is vital,<br>
namely, whether or not the people,<br>
no matter how much<br>
or how little they possess,<br>
regard it and use it<br>
in the way they should?

<br>
The right way<br>
is to regard it<br>
as something entrusted to us<br>
to use for the benefit<br>
of ourselves and others.

<br>
The wrong way<br>
is to look on it as something we own<br>
and can use as we desire<br>
without any duty to others.

<br>
Good or bad conditions<br>
will follow<br>
good or bad use<br>
of property.

<br>What Saint Francis Desired<br>According to Johannes Jorgensen, a Danish convert, living in Assisi:<br>
<br>Saint Francis desired<br>
that men should give up<br>
superfluous possessions.
<br>Saint Francis desired<br>
that men should work<br>
with their hands.
<br>Saint Francis desired<br>
that men should offer their services<br>
as a gift.
<br>Saint Francis desired<br>
that men should ask other people for help<br>
when work failed them.
<br>Saint Francis desired<br>
that men should live<br>
as free as birds.
<br>Saint Francis desired<br>
that men should go through life<br>
giving thanks to God<br>
for His gifts.
<br>Agrarianism<br>
On The Level<br>
<br>
Owen Young says:<br>
"We will never have prosperity<br>
as long as<br>
there is no balance<br>
between industry<br>
and agriculture."

<br>
The farmer sells<br>
in an open market<br>
and is forced to buy<br>
in a restricted market.

<br>
When the farmer gets<br>
a pair of overalls<br>
for a bushel of wheat<br>
the wheat and the overalls<br>
are on the level.

<br>
When the farmer<br>
has to give<br>
two bushels of wheat<br>
for a pair of overalls<br>
the wheat and the overalls<br>
are not on the level.

<br>
Wheat and overalls<br>
must be on the level.

<br>Industrialization<br>
<br>
Lenin said:<br>
"The world cannot be<br>
half industrial<br>
and half agricultural."

<br>
England, Germany,<br>
Japan, and America<br>
have become<br>
industrialized.

<br>
Soviet Russia<br>
is trying to keep up<br>
with England, Germany,<br>
Japan, and America.

<br>
When all the world<br>
becomes industrialized<br>
every country<br>
will be looking<br>
for foreign markets.

<br>
But when every country<br>
becomes industrialized<br>
you will not have<br>
foreign markets.

<br>Mechanized Labor<br>
<br>
Gandhi says:<br>
"Industrialism is evil."

<br>
Industrialism is evil<br>
because it brings idleness<br>
both to the capitalist class<br>
and the working class.

<br>
Idleness does no good<br>
either to the capitalist class<br>
or the working class.

<br>
Creative labor<br>
is what keeps people<br>
out of mischief.

<br>
Creative labor<br>
is craft labor.

<br>
Mechanized labor<br>
is not creative labor.

<br>No Pleasure In Work<br>1.Carlyle says:<br>
"He who has found his work<br>
let him look<br>
for no other blessedness."<br>
<br>
But workmen<br>
cannot find hapiness<br>
in mechanized work.

<br>
As Charles Devas says,<br>
"The great majority<br>
having to perform<br>
some mechanized operation<br>
which requires little thought<br>
and allows no originality<br>
and which<br>
concerns an object<br>
in the transformation of which<br>
whether previous or subsequent<br>
they have no part,<br>
cannot take pleasure<br>
in their work."

<br>Industrialism And Art<br>
<br>
Eric Gill says:<br>
the notion of work<br>
has been separated<br>
from the notion of art.

<br>
The notion of the useful<br>
has been separated<br>
from the notion of the beautiful.

<br>
The artist,<br>
that is to say,<br>
the responsible workman,<br>
has been separated<br>
from all other workmen.

<br>
The factory hand<br>
has no responsibility<br>
for what he produces.

<br>
He has been reduced<br>
to a sub-human condition<br>
of intellectual irresponsibility.

<br>
Industrialism<br>
has released the artist<br>
from the necessity<br>
of making anything useful.

<br>
Industrialism<br>
has also released the workman<br>
from making anything amusing.

<br>From A Chinese<br>
<br>
A Chinese says:<br>
I thought I had become westernized<br>
but now I am becoming repatriated.

<br>
The material progress of America<br>
has dazzled me.

<br>
I wished while there<br>
to transplant what I saw<br>
to China.

<br>
But now that I am home again<br>
I see that our two civilizations<br>
have irreconcilable differences.

<br>
Yours is a machine civilization;<br>
ours is a handicraft civilization.

<br>
Your people<br>
work in factories;<br>
our people<br>
work in shops.

<br>
Your people<br>
produce quality things<br>
that are alike.

<br>
Our people<br>
produce quality things<br>
that are different.

<br>Regard For The Soil<br>
<br>
Andrew Nelson Lytle says:<br>
The escape from industrialism<br>
is not in socialism<br>
or in sovietism.

<br>
The answer lies<br>
in a return to a society<br>
where agriculture is practised<br>
by most of the people.

<br>
It is in fact impossible<br>
for any culture<br>
to be sound and healthy<br>
without a proper regard<br>
for the soil,<br>
no matter<br>
how many urban dwellers<br>
think that their food<br>
comes from groceries<br>
and delicatessens<br>
or their milk from tin cans.

<br>
This ignorance<br>
does not release them<br>
from a final dependence<br>
upon the farm.

<br>Up To Catholics<br>
<br>
Ralph Adams Cram says:<br>
What I propose<br>
is that Catholics<br>
should take up<br>
this back-to-the-land problem<br>
and put it into operation.

<br>
Why Catholics?<br>
Because they realize<br>
more clearly than any others<br>
the shortcomings<br>
of the old capitalist<br>
industrial system.

<br>
They, better than others,<br>
see the threat<br>
that impends.

<br>
They alone understand<br>
that while the family<br>
is the primary social unit,<br>
the community comes next.

<br>
And there is<br>
no sound<br>
and righteous<br>
and enduring community<br>
where all its members<br>
are not substantially<br>
of one mind.

<br>What They Say They Believe<br>
What The Communists Say They Believe<br>
<br>
Communists believe<br>
that the capitalist system<br>
has reached the point<br>
where it no longer works.

<br>
Communists believe<br>
that when the workers<br>
come to the realization<br>
of the downfall of capitalism<br>
they will no longer tolerate it.

<br>

will resort to all means<br>
that may be in their power<br>

in an orderly manner<br>
according to a pre-designed plan.

<br>What The Fascists Say They Believe<br>
<br>
The Fascists believe<br>
in a national economy<br>
for the protection<br>
of national and private interests.

<br>
Fascists believe<br>
in the regulation of industries<br>
so as to assure<br>
a wage for the worker<br>
and a dividend for the investor.

<br>

in class collaboration<br>

<br>What the Catholic Worker Believes<br>
<br>The Catholic Worker believes<br>
in the gentle personalism<br>
of traditional Catholicism.
<br>The Catholic Worker believes<br>
in the personal obligation<br>
of looking after<br>
the needs of our brother.
<br>The Catholic Worker believes<br>
in the daily practice<br>
of the Works of Mercy.

in Houses of Hospitality<br>
for the immediate relief<br>
of those who are in need.
<br>The Catholic Worker believes<br>
in the establishment<br>
of Farming Communes<br>
where each one works<br>
according to his ability<br>
and gets according to his need.
<br>The Catholic Worker believes<br>
in creating a new society<br>
within the shell of the old<br>
with the philosophy of the new,<br>
which is not a new philosophy<br>
but a very old philosophy,<br>
a philosophy so old<br>
that it looks like new.
<br>Disarmament<br>
Right Or Wrong<br>
<br>
Some people say:<br>
"My country<br>
is always right."

<br>
Some people say:<br>
"My country<br>
is always wrong."

<br>
Some people say:<br>
"My country<br>
is sometimes right<br>
and sometimes wrong,<br>
but my country<br>
right or wrong."

<br>
To stick up for one's country<br>
when one's country is wrong<br>
does not make<br>
the country right.

<br>
To stick up for the right<br>
even when the world is wrong<br>
is the only way we know<br>
to make everything right.

<br>Protecting France<br>
<br>
To protect French citizens<br>
living in Algeria<br>
the French took Algeria<br>
from the natives.

<br>
To protect Algeria<br>
the French took control<br>
for Tunisia.

<br>
To protect Senegal<br>
the French took Dahomey,<br>
the Gabon, and the Congo.

<br>
To protect the isle of Reunion<br>
the French took Madagascar.

<br>
They took Madagascar<br>
for another reason.

<br>
The other reason was<br>
that the English<br>
wished to take it.

<br>
When the English<br>
take something<br>
the French say:<br>
"The English do that<br>
because they are grabbers."

<br>
When the French take something,<br>
the French say:<br>
"We do that<br>
because we are<br>
good patriots."

<br>Protecting England<br>
<br>
To protect the British Isles<br>
the English took the sea.

<br>
To protect the sea<br>
the English took Gibraltar,<br>
Canada, and India.

<br>
To protect India<br>
the English went to Egypt.

<br>
To protect Egypt<br>
the English took the Sudan.

<br>
To protect the Sudan<br>
the English forced the French<br>
to leave Fashoda.

<br>
To protect the Cape and Natal<br>
the English took the Transvaal.

<br>
To protect South Africa<br>
the English prevented the French<br>
from giving Agadir<br>
to Germany.

<br>
So the English<br>
are just as good<br>
or just as bad<br>
as the French.

<br>Civilizing Ethiopia<br>
<br>
The French believe<br>
that trade follows the flag.

<br>
So do the English,<br>
so do the Germans,<br>
so do the Japanese,<br>
so do the Italians.

<br>
Italy is in Ethopia<br>
for the same reason<br>
that the French<br>
are in Algeria,<br>
the English in India,<br>
the Japanese in Manchuria.

<br>
The Italians say<br>
thatthe Ethopians<br>
are not civilized.

<br>
The last war proves<br>
that Europeans<br>
are no more civilized<br>
than the Africans.

<br>
So Europeans<br>
ought to find a way<br>
to become civilized<br>
before thinking<br>
about the best way<br>
to civilize Africans.

<br>
Theodore Roosevelt used to say:<br>
"If you want peace<br>
prepare for war."

<br>
So everybody prepared for war<br>
but war preparations<br>
did not bring peace;<br>
they brought war.

<br>
Since war preparations<br>
brought war,<br>
why not quit<br>
preparing for war.

<br>
If nations preparing for peace<br>
instead of preparing for war,<br>
they might have peace.

<br>
Aristide Briand used to say:<br>
"The best kind of disarmament<br>
is the disarmament of the heart."

<br>
The disarmament of Germany<br>
by the Allies<br>
was not the product<br>
of a change of heart<br>
on the part of the Allies<br>
toward Germany.

 <br>A theologian is generally understood to be a person who teaches or is educated in theology. Its root form, theology, is derived from the Greek θεολογία (theologia), from θεός (theos, god) and λόγος (logos), with the suffix ια (ia, "state of," "property of," "place of"). A literal translation of the Greek word would be "to talk about <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>." Evagrius Ponticus wrote that "If you are a theologian, you will pray truly. And if you pray truly, you are a theologian." (Treatise On Prayer, 61).<br>Theologians use various forms of analysis and argument to help understand, explain, test, critique, defend, or promote religious topics. Theology had its origin in classical Greek thought, but was given new senses within the Christian context as the Fathers of the Church.<br><br>

 <br>The Catholic Worker Movement is a global network of intentional communities and individuals inspired by the vision of <a class="internal-link" data-href="Dorothy Day.md" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/Dorothy Day.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dorothy Day</a> and <a class="internal-link" data-href="Peter Maurin.md" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/Peter Maurin.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Peter Maurin</a>. It's a grassroots movement that seeks to live out the Gospel message by serving the poor, promoting social justice, and building alternative forms of community.  <br>The movement was founded in 1933 with the publication of The Catholic Worker newspaper, which became a platform for Day and Maurin to share their ideas on poverty, nonviolence, and community living. The paper's mission was to provide news, commentary, and inspiration to those working towards social change.  <br>Over time, the movement grew to include various forms of activism, such as:  <br>
<br>Houses of Hospitality: Providing food, shelter, and care for the poor and homeless.  
<br>Anti-war and anti-nuclear efforts: Promoting nonviolence and peaceful conflict resolution.  
<br>Ecological initiatives: Focusing on environmental sustainability and conservation.  
<br>The Catholic Worker Movement is characterized by its commitment to:  <br>
<br>Nonviolent direct action  
<br>Community living among the poor  
<br>Simple, self-sufficient lifestyles  
<br>Advocacy for social justice and human rights

 <br><br>Building a framework (the Saint Maker) to form evangelists, meant to encompass all aspects of life, making use of any technologies now available, and those developed in the future. The tool for developing the Saint Maker will be a university. The university will consist of teaching companies where students work to cover tuition. The three-fold reason for this model is: to assist in the university’s mission by being more inter-connected with daily life, providing various benefits to students, and to help reach financial self-sufficiency as quickly as possible.<br><br>Problem: how to evangelize the whole world?<br>Solution: form faith-filled, hard-working Catholics. They will evangelize the world.<br>Problem: how to form these Catholics?<br>Solution: through a framework of formation that catechizes praxatically and formally.<br>Problem: present frameworks (parish catechesis, Catholic schools [including home schools], Catholic universities, and even parishes in general), have a low success rate compared to their failures.<br>Solution: our present methods are too fragmented. A true solution encompasses all aspects of a person’s life. As God meets people at all times in their lives, the solution must be present at all times and in all places as well. We need a way to connect everything: parish life (liturgy, prayer, charity), family life, catechesis, learning, social life, financial life, business life, family life.<br>Problem: there presently exists no way to extrinsically connect all these things outside of the individual them-self (who obviously connects all these things by being the point of conflux).<br>Solution: technology for a complete solution is not yet achieved, but using existent technological means, a framework could be made that begins to bridge all those areas of life.<br>That is our goal.<br>A way to connect prayer and work, family and friends, liturgy and learning. All within an explicitly and overwhelmingly Catholic context. To form disciples of all nations.<br><br>The overarching goal is to use any present and future technological means to create a framework for Catholic life that promotes sanctity.<br>The task is the same as it’s always been, but new tools to aid in accomplishing that task are continually developed.<br>A full answer of what the Saint Maker will look like (this nexus that impregnates the whole life of a Catholic with Catholicity), is not yet clear.<br>To find clarity on how it needs to be designed, the first step is to develop a place for the incubation of this nexus, and that place is a university.<br><br>There is no need to reinvent the wheel, the Catholic <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> knows how to run universities.<br>This one will have a goal: making a community that has both the capability and the resources to develop the Saint Maker.<br>Since we will be building a new university, there are aspects that must be considered to make it the ideal incubation chamber for our task. The typical divide from academia and everyday life, is not helpful in regards to the goal of this university. In bridging the two, we can build a university that is better equipped to design and build the Saint Maker, as well as provide benefits to students not found in a typical university setting.<br><br>A student begins by applying online. This first step is even a class, as the application is a tutorial in how to effectively fill out applications for employment. Part of that application is applying for your first job in the university.<br>If accepted, follow up tutorials are begun to prepare for a job interview, which will also be a teaching opportunity. Concurrently, tutorials are begun for placement in a dorm, which is carried out exactly the same as applying for an apartment.<br>With acceptance to the university, a final job offer, and a dorm “rented,” the student is ready to move in.<br>The first semester is practicum oriented: classes in everything you need to be a successful adult in this world (faith being most important, so classes in how to live a saintly life, but also money management, time management, how to study, how to learn, how to think effectively, how to keep a house, etc).<br>Towards the end of the first semester, begin transition into formal education. Making use of online and in-person classes (both developed by the university but, especially initially, also from other universities), and also other programs for blue collar work (apprenticeships and certificate programs).<br>During first semester, the student will apply for a mentor. This mentor will help them through the growing pains of the first semester (which will be substantial, especially in comparison with your typical university experience [due to essentially needing to act like an adult from day one]), and should also function as a very basic spiritual advisor.<br>There will be no separation between academia and the rest of the world, this will be exactly like the real world. There will be no breaks in the student’s job, they’ll need to negotiate time off to visit their families.<br>The university will also function as it’s own micro-economy. Students will be paying their way by working, but a profit-sharing system will help encourage diligent work, help them learn money management, and further stimulate the local economy.<br>Our hypothetical student will continue into their second year, able at any time to apply for a different job or a different dorm. University life is year-round, both to better integrate into real life, but also to avoid any difficulties in staffing university jobs.<br>As the student approaches the end of year two, it’s their turn to become a mentor.

 <br>The term church (Anglo-Saxon, cirice, circe; Modern German, Kirche; Swedish, Kyrka) is the name employed in the Teutonic languages to render the Greek ekklesia (ecclesia), the term by which the New Testament writers denote the society founded by Our Lord <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>. The derivation of the word has been much debated. It is now agreed that it is derived from the Greek kyriakon (cyriacon), i.e. the Lord's house, a term which from the third century was used, as well as ekklesia, to signify a Christian place of worship. This, though the less usual expression, had apparently obtained currency among the Teutonic races. The Northern tribes had been accustomed to pillage the Christian churches of the empire, long before their own conversion. Hence, even prior to the arrival of the Saxons in Britain, their language had acquired words to designate some of the externals of the Christian religion.<br>The present article is arranged as follows:<br>
<br>The term Ecclesia
<br>The Church in prophecy
<br>Its constitution by Christ; the Church after the Ascension
<br>Its organization by the Apostles
<br>The Church, a divine society
<br>The Church, the necessary means of salvation
<br>Visibility of the Church
<br>The principle of authority; infallibility; jurisdiction
<br>Members of the Church
<br>Indefectibility of the Church; continuity
<br>Universality of the Church; the "Branch" Theory
<br>Notes of the Church
<br>The Church, a perfect society
<br><br>In order to understand the precise force of this word, something must first be said as to its employment by the Septuagint translators of the Old Testament. Although in one or two places (Psalm 25:5; Judith 6:21; etc.) the word is used without religious signification, merely in the sense of "an assembly", this is not usually the case. Ordinarily it is employed as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew qahal, i.e., the entire community of the children of Israel viewed in their religious aspect. Two Hebrew words are employed in the Old Testament to signify the congregation of Israel, viz. qahal 'êdah. In the Septuagint these are rendered, respectively, ekklesia and synagoge. Thus in Proverbs 5:14, where the words occur together, "in the midst of the church and the congregation", the Greek rendering is en meso ekklesias kai synagoges. The distinction is indeed not rigidly observed — thus in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, both words are regularly represented by synagoge — but it is adhered to in the great majority of cases, and may be regarded as an established rule. In the writings of the New Testament the words are sharply distinguished. With them ecclesia denotes the Church of Christ; synagoga, the Jews still adhering to the worship of the Old Covenant. Occasionally, it is true, ecclesia is employed in its general significance of "assembly" (Acts 19:32; 1 Corinthians 14:19); and synagoga occurs once in reference to a gathering of Christians, though apparently of a non-religious character (James 2:2) But ecclesia is never used by the Apostles to denote the Jewish Church. The word as a technical expression had been transferred to the community of Christian believers.<br>It has been frequently disputed whether there is any difference in the signification of the two words. St. Augustine (Enarration on Psalm 77) distinguishes them on the ground that ecclesia is indicative of the calling together of men, synagoga of the forcible herding together of irrational creatures: "congregatio magis pecorum convocatio magis hominum intelligi solet". But it may be doubted whether there is any foundation for this view. It would appear, however, that the term qahal, was used with the special meaning of "those called by God to eternal life", while 'êdah, denoted merely "the actually existing Jewish community" (Schürer, Hist. Jewish People, II, 59). Though the evidence for this distinction is drawn from the Mishna, and thus belongs to a somewhat later date, yet the difference in meaning probably existed at the time of Christ's ministry. But however this may have been, His intention in employing the term, hitherto used of the Hebrew people viewed as a church, to denote the society He Himself was establishing cannot be mistaken. It implied the claim that this society now constituted the true people of God, that the Old Covenant was passing away, and that He, the promised Messias, was inaugurating a New Covenant with a New Israel.<br>As signifying the Church, the word Ecclesia is used by Christian writers, sometimes in a wider, sometimes in a more restricted sense.<br>
<br>It is employed to denote all who, from the beginning of the world, have believed in the one true God, and have been made His children by grace. In this sense, it is sometimes distinguished, signifying the Church before the Old Covenant, the Church of the Old Covenant, or the Church of the New Covenant. Thus St. Gregory (Book V, Epistle 18) writes: "Sancti ante legem, sancti sub lege, sancti sub gratiâ, omnes hi . . . in membris Ecclesiæ sunt constituti" (The <a data-href="saint" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Saints/saint.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">saint</a>s before the Law, the <a data-href="saint" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Saints/saint.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">saint</a>s under the Law, and the <a data-href="saint" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Saints/saint.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">saint</a>s under grace — all these are constituted members of the Church).
<br>It may signify the whole body of the faithful, including not merely the members of the Church who are alive on earth but those, too, whether in heaven or in purgatory, who form part of the one communion of <a data-href="saint" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Saints/saint.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">saint</a>s. Considered thus, the Church is divided into the Church Militant, the Church Suffering, and the Church Triumphant.
<br>It is further employed to signify the Church Militant of the New Testament. Even in this restricted acceptation, there is some variety in the use of the term. The disciples of a single locality are often referred to in the New Testament as a Church (Revelation 2:18; Romans 16:4; Acts 9:31), and St. Paul even applies the term to disciples belonging to a single household (Romans 16:5; 1 Corinthians 16:19, Colossians 4:15; Philemon 1-2). Moreover, it may designate specially those who exercise the office of teaching and ruling the faithful, the Ecclesia Docens (Matthew 18:17), or again the governed as distinguished from their pastors, the Ecclesia Discens (Acts 20:28). In all these cases the name belonging to the whole is applied to a part. The term, in its full meaning, denotes the whole body of the faithful, both rulers and ruled, throughout the world (Ephesians 1:22; Colossians 1:18). It is in this meaning that the Church is treated of in the present article. As thus understood, the definition of the Church given by Bellarmine is that usually adopted by Catholic theologians: "A body of men united together by the profession of the same Christian Faith, and by participation in the same sacraments, under the governance of lawful pastors, more especially of the Roman Pontiff, the sole vicar of Christ on earth" (Coetus hominum ejusdem christianæ fidei professione, et eorumdem sacramentorum communione colligatus, sub regimine legitimorum pastorum et præcipue unius Christi in Terris vicarii Romani Pontificis. — Bellarmine, De Eccl., III, ii, 9). The accuracy of this definition will appear in the course of the article.
<br><br>Hebrew prophecy relates in almost equal proportions to the person and to the work of the Messias. This work was conceived as consisting of the establishment of a kingdom, in which he was to reign over a regenerated Israel. The prophetic writings describe for us with precision many of the characteristics which were to distinguish that kingdom. Christ during His ministry affirmed not only that the prophecies relating to the Messias were fulfilled in His own person, but also that the expected Messianic kingdom was none other than His Church. A consideration of the features of the kingdom as depicted by the Prophets, must therefore greatly assist us in understanding Christ's intentions in the institution of the Church. Indeed many of the expressions employed by Him in relation to the society He was establishing are only intelligible in the Light of these prophecies and of the consequent expectations of the Jewish people. It will moreover appear that we have a weighty argument for the supernatural character of the Christian revelation in the precise fulfillment of the sacred oracles.<br>A characteristic feature of the Messianic kingdom, as predicted, is its universal extent. Not merely the twelve tribes, but the Gentiles are to yield allegiance to the Son of David. All kings are to serve and obey him; his dominion is to extend to the ends of the earth (Psalm 21:28 sq.; 2:7-12; 116:1; Zechariah 9:10). Another series of remarkable passages declares that the subject nations will possess the unity conferred by a common faith and a common worship — a feature represented under the striking image of the concourse of all peoples and nations to worship at Jerusalem. "It shall come to pass in the last days (i.e. in the Messianic Era] . . . that many nations shall say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go forth out of Sion, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem" (Micah 4:1-2; cf. Isaiah 2:2; Zechariah 8:3). This unity of worship is to be the fruit of a Divine revelation common to all the inhabitants of the earth (Zechariah 14:8).<br>Corresponding to the triple office of the Messias as priest, prophet, and king, it will be noted that in relation to the kingdom the Sacred Writings lay stress on three points:<br>
<br>it is to be endowed with a new and peculiar sacrificial system
<br>it is to be the kingdom of truth possessed of a Divine revelation
<br>it is to be governed by an authority emanating from the Messias.
<br>In regard to the first of these points, the priesthood of the Messias Himself is explicitly stated (Psalm 109:4); while it is further taught that the worship which He is to inaugurate shall supersede the sacrifices of the Old Dispensation. This is implied, as the Apostle tells us, in the very title, "a priest after the order of Melchisedech"; and the same truth is contained in the prediction that a new priesthood is to be formed, drawn from other peoples besides the Israelites (Isaiah 66:18), and in the words of the Prophet Malachias which foretell the institution of a new sacrifice to be offered "from the rising of the sun even to the going down" (Malachi 1:11). The sacrifices offered by the priesthood of the Messianic kingdom are to endure as long as day and night shall last (Jeremiah 33:20).<br>The revelation of the Divine truth under the New Dispensation attested by Jeremias: "Behold the days shall come saith the Lord, and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Juda . . . and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, saying: Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least of them even to the greatest" (Jeremiah 31:31, 34), while Zacharias assures us that in those days Jerusalem shall be known as the city of truth. (Zechariah 8:3).<br>The passages which foretell that the Kingdom will possess a peculiar principle of authority in the personal rule of the Messias are numerous (e.g. Psalms 2 and 71; Isaiah 9:6 sq.); but in relation to Christ's own words, it is of interest to observe that in some of these passages the prediction is expressed under the metaphor of a shepherd guiding and governing his flock (Ezekiel 34:23; 37:24-28). It is noteworthy, moreover, that just as the prophecies in regard to the priestly office foretell the appointment of a priesthood subordinate to the Messias, so those which relate to the office of government indicate that the Messias will associate with Himself other "shepherds", and will exercise His authority over the nations through rulers delegated to govern in His name (Jeremiah 18:6; Psalm 44:17; cf. St. Augustine, Enarration on Psalm 44, no. 32). Another feature of the kingdom is to be the sanctity of its members. The way to it is to be called "the holy way: the unclean shall not pass over it". The uncircumcised and unclean are not to enter into the renewed Jerusalem (Isaiah 35:8; 52:1).<br>The later uninspired apocalyptic literature of the Jews shows us how profoundly these predictions had influenced their national hopes, and explains for us the intense expectation among the populace described in the Gospel narratives. In these works as in the inspired prophecies the traits of the Messianic kingdom present two very different aspects. On the one hand, the Messias is a Davidic king who gathers together the dispersed of Israel, and establishes on this earth a kingdom of purity and sinlessness (Psalms of Solomon, xvii). The foreign foe is to be subdued (Assumpt. Moses, c. x) and the wicked are to be judged in the valley of the son of Hinnon (Enoch, xxv, xxvii, xc). On the other hand, the kingdom is described in eschatological characters. The Messias is pre-existent and Divine (Enoch, Simil., xlviii, 3); the kingdom He establishes is to be a heavenly kingdom inaugurated by a great world-catastrophe, which separates this world (aion outos), from the world to come (mellon). This catastrophe is to be accompanied by a judgment both of angels and of men (Jubilees, x, 8; v, 10; Assumpt. Moses, x, 1). The dead will rise (Psalms of Solomon, 3.11) and all the members of the Messianic kingdom will become like to the Messias (Enoch, Simil., xc, 37). This twofold aspect of the Jewish hopes in regard to the coming Messias must be borne in mind, if Christ's use of the expression "Kingdom of God" is to be understood. Not infrequently, it is true, He employs it in an eschatological sense. But far more commonly He uses it of the kingdom set up on this earth — of His Church. These are indeed, not two kingdoms, but one. The Kingdom of God to be established at the last day is the Church in her final triumph.<br><br>The Baptist proclaimed the near approach of the Kingdom of God, and of the Messianic Era. He bade all who would share its blessings prepare themselves by penance. His own mission, he said, was to prepare the way of the Messias. To his disciples he indicated Jesus of Nazareth as the Messias whose advent he had declared (John 1:29-31). From the very commencement of His ministry Christ laid claim in an explicit way to the Messianic dignity. In the synagogue at Nazareth (Luke 4:21) He asserts that the prophecies are fulfilled in His person; He declares that He is greater than Solomon (Luke 11:31), more venerable than the Temple (Matthew 12:6), Lord of the Sabbath (Luke 6:5). John, He says, is Elias, the promised forerunner (Matthew 17:12); and to John's messengers He vouchsafes the proofs of His Messianic dignity which they request (Luke 7:22). He demands implicit faith on the ground of His Divine legation (John 6:29). His public entry into Jerusalem was the acceptance by the whole people of a claim again and again reiterated before them. The theme of His preaching throughout is the Kingdom of God which He has come to establish. St. Mark, describing the beginning of His ministry, says that He came into Galilee saying, "The time is accomplished, and the Kingdom of God is at hand". For the kingdom which He was even then establishing in their midst, the Law and the Prophets had been, He said, but a preparation (Luke 16:16; cf. Matthew 4:23; 9:35; 13:17; 21:43; 24:14; Mark 1:14; Luke 4:43; 8:1; 9:2, 60; 18:17).<br>When it is asked what is this kingdom of which Christ spoke, there can be but one answer. It is His Church, the society of those who accept His Divine legation, and admit His right to the obedience of faith which He claimed. His whole activity is directed to the establishment of such a society: He organizes it and appoints rulers over it, establishes rites and ceremonies in it, transfers to it the name which had hitherto designated the Jewish Church, and solemnly warns the Jews that the kingdom was no longer theirs, but had been taken from them and given to another people. The several steps taken by Christ in organizing the Church are traced by the Evangelists. He is represented as gathering numerous disciples, but as selecting twelve from their number to be His companions in an especial manner. These share His life. To them He reveals the more hidden parts of His doctrine (Matthew 13:11). He sends them as His deputies to preach the kingdom, and bestows on them the power to work miracles. All are bound to accept their message; and those who refuse to listen to them shall meet a fate more terrible than that of Sodom and Gomorrha (Matthew 10:1-15). The Sacred Writers speak of these twelve chosen disciples in a manner indicating that they are regarded as forming a corporate body. In several passages they are still termed "the twelve" even when the number, understood literally, would be inexact. The name is applied to them when they have been reduced to eleven by the defection of Judas, on an occasion when only ten of them were present, and again after the appointment of St. Paul has increased their number to thirteen (Luke 24:33; John 20:24; 1 Corinthians 15:5; Revelation 21:14).<br>In this constitution of the Apostolate Christ lays the foundation of His Church. But it is not till the action of official Judaism had rendered it manifestly impossible to hope the Jewish Church would admit His claim, that He prescribes for the Church as a body independent of the synagogue and possessed of an administration of her own. After the breach had become definite, He calls the Apostles together and speaks to them of the judicial action of the Church, distinguishing, in an unmistakable manner, between the private individual who undertakes the work of fraternal correction, and the ecclesiastical authority empowered to pronounce a judicial sentence (Matthew 18:15-17). To the jurisdiction thus conferred He attached a Divine sanction. A sentence thus pronounced, He assured the Apostles, should be ratified in heaven. A further step was the appointment of St. Peter to be the chief of the Twelve. For this position he had already been designated (Matthew 16:15 sqq.) on an occasion previous to that just mentioned: at Cæsarea Philippi, Christ had declared him to be the rock on which He would build His Church, thus affirming that the continuance and increase of the Church would rest on the office created in the person of Peter. To him, moreover, were to be given the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven — an expression signifying the gift of plenary authority (Isaiah 22:22). The promise thus made was fulfilled after the Resurrection, on the occasion narrated in John 21. Here Christ employs a simile used on more than one occasion by Himself to denote His own relation to the members of His Church — that of the shepherd and his flock. His solemn charge, "Feed my sheep", constituted Peter the common shepherd of the whole collective flock. (For a further consideration of the Petrine texts see article PRIMACY.) To the twelve Christ committed the charge of spreading the kingdom among all nations, appointing the rite of baptism as the one means of admission to a participation in its privileges (Matthew 28:19).<br>In the course of this article detailed consideration will be given to the principal characteristics of the Church. Christ's teaching on this point may be briefly summarized here. It is to be a kingdom ruled in His absence by men (Matthew 18:18; John 21:17). It is therefore a visible theocracy; and it will be substituted for the Jewish theocracy that has rejected Him (Matthew 21:43). In it, until the day of judgment, the bad will be mingled with the good (Matthew 13:41). Its extent will be universal (Matthew 28:19), and its duration to the end of time (Matthew 13:49); all powers that oppose it shall be crushed (Matthew 21:44). Moreover, it will be a supernatural kingdom of truth, in the world, though not of it (John 18:36). It will be one and undivided, and this unity shall be a witness to all men that its founder came from God (John 17:21).<br>It is to be noticed that certain recent critics contest the positions maintained in the preceding paragraphs. They deny alike that Christ claimed to be the Messias, and that the kingdom of which He spoke was His Church. Thus, as regards Christ's claim to Messianic dignity, they say that Christ does not declare Himself to be the Messias in His preaching: that He bids the possessed who proclaimed Him the Son of God be silent: that the people did not suspect His Messiahship, but formed various extravagant hypotheses as to his personality. It is manifestly impossible within the limits of this article to enter on a detailed discussion of these points. But, in the light of the testimony of the passages above cited, it will be seen that the position is entirely untenable. In reference to the Kingdom of God, many of the critics hold that the current Jewish conception was wholly eschatological, and that Christ's references to it must one and all be thus interpreted. This view renders inexplicable the numerous passages in which Christ speaks of the kingdom as present, and further involves a misconception as to the nature of Jewish expectations, which, as has been seen, together with eschatological traits, contained others of a different character. Harnack (What is Christianity? p. 62) holds that in its inner meaning the kingdom as conceived by Christ is "a purely religious blessing, the inner link of the soul with the living God". Such an interpretation can in no possible way be reconciled with Christ's utterances on the subject. The whole tenor of his expressions is to lay stress on the concept of a theocratic society.<br><br>The doctrine of the Church as set forth by the Apostles after the Ascension is in all respects identical with the teaching of Christ just described. St. Peter, in his first sermon, delivered on the day of Pentecost, declares that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messianic king (Acts 2:36). The means of salvation which he indicates is baptism; and by baptism his converts are aggregated to the society of disciples (Acts 2:41). Though in these days the Christians still availed themselves of the Temple services, yet from the first the brotherhood of Christ formed a society essentially distinct from the synagogue. The reason why St. Peter bids his hearers accept baptism is none other than that they may "save themselves from this unbelieving generation". Within the society of believers not only were the members united by common rites, but the tie of unity was so close as to bring about in the Church of Jerusalem that condition of things in which the disciples had all things common (2:44).<br>Christ had declared that His kingdom should be spread among all nations, and had committed the execution of the work to the twelve (Matthew 28:19). Yet the universal mission of the Church revealed itself but gradually. St. Peter indeed makes mention of it from the first (Acts 2:39). But in the earliest years the Apostolic activity is confined to Jerusalem alone. Indeed an old tradition (Apollonius, cited by Eusebius Church History V.17, and Clement of Alexandria, Stromata VI.5) asserts that Christ had bidden the Apostles wait twelve years in Jerusalem before dispersing to carry their message elsewhere. The first notable advance occurs consequent on the persecution which arose after the death of Stephen, A.D. 37. This was the occasion of the preaching of the Gospel to the Samaritans, a people excluded from the privileges of Israel, though acknowledging the Mosaic Law (Acts 8:5). A still further expansion resulted from the revelation directing St. Peter to admit to baptism Cornelius, a devout Gentile, i.e. one associated to the Jewish religion but not circumcised. From this time forward circumcision and the observance of the Law were not a condition requisite for incorporation into the Church. But the final step of admitting those Gentiles who had known no previous connection with the religion of Israel, and whose life had been spent in paganism, was not taken till more than fifteen years after Christ's Ascension; it did not occur, it would seem, before the day described in Acts 13:46, when, at Antioch in Pisidia, Paul and Barnabas announced that since the Jews accounted themselves unworthy of eternal life they would "turn to the Gentiles".<br>In the Apostolic teaching the term Church, from the very first, takes the place of the expression Kingdom of God (Acts 5:11). Where others than the Jews were concerned, the greater suitability of the former name is evident; for Kingdom of God had special reference to Jewish beliefs. But the change of title only emphasizes the social unity of the members. They are the new congregation of Israel — the theocratic polity: they are the people (laos) of God (Acts 15:14; Romans 9:25; 2 Corinthians 6:16; 1 Peter 2:9 sq.; Hebrews 8:10; Revelation 18:4; 21:3). By their admission to the Church, the Gentiles have been grafted in and form part of God's fruitful olive-tree, while apostate Israel has been broken off (Romans 11:24). St. Paul, writing to his Gentile converts at Corinth, terms the ancient Hebrew Church "our fathers" (1 Corinthians 10:1). Indeed from time to time the previous phraseology is employed, and the Gospel message is termed the preaching of the Kingdom of God (Acts 20:25; 28:31).<br>Within the Church the Apostles exercised that regulative power with which Christ had endowed them. It was no chaotic mob, but a true society possessed of a corporate life, and organized in various orders. The evidence shows the twelve to have possessed (a) a power of jurisdiction, in virtue of which they wielded a legislative and judicial authority, and (b) a magisterial office to teach the Divine revelation entrusted to them. Thus (a) we find St. Paul authoritatively prescribing for the order and discipline of the churches. He does not advise; he directs (1 Corinthians 11:34; 16:1; Titus 1:5). He pronounces judicial sentence (1 Corinthians 5:5; 2 Corinthians 2:10), and his sentences, like those of other Apostles, receive at times the solemn sanction of miraculous punishment (1 Timothy 1:20; Acts 5:1-10). In like manner he bids his delegate Timothy hear the causes even of priests, and rebuke, in the sight of all, those who sin (1 Timothy 5:19 sq.). (b) With no less definiteness does he assert that the Apostolate carries with it a doctrinal authority, which all are bound to recognize. God has sent them, he affirms, to claim "the obedience of faith" (Romans 1:5; 15:18). Further, his solemnly expressed desire, that even if an angel from heaven were to preach another doctrine to the Galatians than that which he had delivered to them, he should be anathema (Galatians 1:8), involves a claim to infallibility in the teaching of revealed truth.<br>While the whole Apostolic College enjoyed this power in the Church, St. Peter always appears in that position of primacy which Christ assigned to him. It is Peter who receives into the Church the first converts, alike from Judaism and from heathenism (Acts 2:41; 10:5 sq.), who works the first miracle (Acts 3:1 sqq.), who inflicts the first ecclesiastical penalty (Acts 5:1 sqq.). It is Peter who casts out of the Church the first heretic, Simon Magus (Acts 8:21), who makes the first Apostolic visitation of the churches (Acts 9:32), and who pronounces the first dogmatic decision (Acts 15:7). (See Schanz, III, p. 460.) So indisputable was his position that when St. Paul was about to undertake the work of preaching to the heathen the Gospel which Christ had revealed to him, he regarded it as necessary to obtain recognition from Peter (Galatians 1:18). More than this was not needful: for the approbation of Peter was definitive.<br><br>Few subjects have been so much debated during the past half-century as the organization of the primitive Church. The present article cannot deal with the whole of this wide subject. Its scope is limited to a single point. An endeavour will be made to estimate the existing information regarding the Apostolic Age itself. Further light is thrown on the matter by a consideration of the organization that is found to have existed in the period immediately subsequent to the death of the last Apostle. (See BISHOP.) The independent evidence derived from the consideration of each of these periods will, in the opinion of the present writer, be found, when fairly weighed, to yield similar results. Thus the conclusions here advanced, over and above their intrinsic value, derive support from the independent witness of another series of authorities tending in all essentials to confirm their accuracy. The question at issue is, whether the Apostles did, or did not, establish in the Christian communities a hierarchical organization. All Catholic scholars, together with some few Protestants, hold that they did so. The opposite view is maintained by the rationalist critics, together with the greater number of Protestants.<br>In considering the evidence of the New Testament on the subject, it appears at once that there is a marked difference between the state of things revealed in the later New Testament writings, and that which appears in those of an earlier date. In the earlier writings we find but little mention of an official organization. Such official positions as may have existed would seem to have been of minor importance in the presence of the miraculous charismata of the Holy Spirit conferred upon individuals, and fitting them to act as organs of the community in various grades. St. Paul in his earlier Epistles has no messages for the bishops or deacons, although the circumstances dealt with in the Epistles to the Corinthians and in that to the Galatians would seem to suggest a reference to the local rulers of the Church. When he enumerates the various functions to which God has called various members of the Church, he does not give us a list of Church offices. "God", he says, "hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors [didaskaloi]; after that miracles; then the graces of healings, helps, governments, kinds of tongues" (1 Corinthians 12:28). This is not a list of official designations. It is a list of "charismata" bestowed by the Holy Spirit, enabling the recipient to fulfill some special function. The only term which forms an exception to this is that of apostle. Here the word is doubtless used in the sense in which it signifies the twelve and St. Paul only. As thus applied the Apostolate was a distinct office, involving a personal mission received from the Risen Lord Himself (1 Corinthians 1:1; Galatians 1:1). Such a position was of altogether too special a character for its recipients to be placed in any other category. The term could indeed be used in a wider reference. It is used of Barnabas (Acts 14:13) and of Andronicus and Junias, St. Paul's kinsmen (Romans 16:7). In this extended signification it is apparently equivalent to evangelist (Ephesians 4:11; 2 Timothy 4:5) and denotes those "apostolic men", who, like the Apostles, went from place to place labouring in new fields, but who had received their commission from them, and not from Christ in person. (See APOSTLES.)<br>The "prophets", the second class mentioned, were men to whom it was given to speak from time to time under the direct influence of the Holy Spirit as the recipients of supernatural inspiration (Acts 13:2; 15:23; 21:11; etc.). By the nature of the case the exercise of such a function could be occasional only. The "charisma" of the "doctors" (or teachers) differed from that of the prophets, in that it could be used continuously. They had received the gift of intelligent insight into revealed truth, and the power to impart it to others. It is manifest that those who possessed such a power must have exercised a function of vital moment to the Church in those first days, when the Christian communities consisted to so large an extent of new converts. The other "charismata" mentioned do not call for special notice. But the prophets and teachers would appear to have possessed an importance as organs of the community, eclipsing that of the local ministry. Thus in Acts 13:1, it is simply related that there were in the Church which was at Antioch prophets and doctors. There is no mention of bishops or deacons. And in the Didache — a work as it would seem of the first century, written before the last Apostle had passed away — the author enjoins respect for the bishops and deacons, on the ground that they have a claim similar to that of the prophets and doctors. "Appoint for yourselves", he writes, "bishops and deacons, worthy of the Lord, men who are meek, and not lovers of money, and true and approved; for unto you they also perform the service [leitourgousi ten leitourgian] of the prophets and doctors. Therefore despise them not: for they are your honourable men along with the prophets and teachers" (Acts 15).<br>It would appear, then, indisputable that in the earliest years of the Christian Church ecclesiastical functions were in a large measure fulfilled by men who had been specially endowed for this purpose with "charismata" of the Holy Spirit, and that as long as these gifts endured, the local ministry occupied a position of less importance and influence. Yet, though this be the case, there would seem to be ample ground for holding that the local ministry was of Apostolic institution: and, further, that towards the later part of the Apostolic Age the abundant "charismata" were ceasing, and that the Apostles themselves took measures to determine the position of the official hierarchy as the directive authority of the Church. The evidence for the existence of such a local ministry is plentiful in the later Epistles of St. Paul (Philippians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus). The Epistle to the Philippians opens with a special greeting to the bishops and deacons. Those who hold these official positions are recognized as the representatives in some sort of the Church. Throughout the letter there is no mention of the "charismata", which figure so largely in the earlier Epistles. It is indeed urged by Hort (Christian Ecclesia, p. 211) that even here these terms are not official titles. But in view of their employment as titles in documents so nearly contemporary, as the Epistle of Clement 4 and the Didache, such a contention seems devoid of all probability.<br>In the Pastoral Epistles the new situation appears even more clearly. The purpose of these writings was to instruct Timothy and Titus regarding the manner in which they were to organize the local Churches. The total absence of all reference to the spiritual gifts can scarcely be otherwise explained than by supposing that they no longer existed in the communities, or that they were at most exceptional phenomena. Instead, we find the Churches governed by a hierarchical organization of bishops, sometimes also termed presbyters, and deacons. That the terms bishop and presbyter are synonymous is evident from Titus 1:5-7: "I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest . . . ordain priests in every city . . . For a bishop must be without crime." These presbyters form a corporate body (1 Timothy 4:14), and they are entrusted with the twofold charge of governing the Church (1 Timothy 3:5) and of teaching (1 Timothy 3:2; Titus 1:9). The selection of those who are to fill this post does not depend on the possession of supernatural gifts. It is required that they should not be unproved neophytes, that they should be under no charge, should have displayed moral fitness for the work, and should be capable of teaching. (1 Timothy 3:2-7; Titus 1:5-9) The appointment to this office was by a solemn laying on of hands (1 Timothy 5:22). Some words addressed by St. Paul to Timothy, in reference to the ceremony as it had taken place in Timothy's case, throw light upon its nature. "I admonish thee", he writes, "that thou stir up the grace (charisma) of God, which is in thee by the laying on of my hands" (2 Timothy 1:6). The rite is here declared to be the means by which a charismatic gift is conferred; and, further, the gift in question, like the baptismal character, is permanent in its effects. The recipient needs but to "waken into life" [anazopyrein] the grace he thus possesses in order to avail himself of it. It is an abiding endowment. There can be no reason for asserting that the imposition of hands, by which Timothy was instructed to appoint the presbyters to their office, was a rite of a different character, a mere formality without practical import.<br>With the evidence before us, certain other notices in the New Testament writings, pointing to the existence of this local ministry, may be considered. There is mention of presbyters at Jerusalem at a date apparently immediately subsequent to the dispersion of the Apostles (Acts 11:30; cf. 15:2; 16:4; 21:18). Again, we are told that Paul and Barnabas, as they retraced their steps on their first missionary journey, appointed presbyters in every Church (Acts 14:22). So too the injunction to the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 5:12) to have regard to those who are over them in the Lord (proistamenoi; cf. Romans 12:6) would seem to imply that there also St. Paul had invested certain members of the community with a pastoral charge. Still more explicit is the evidence contained in the account of St. Paul's interview with the Ephesian elders (Acts 20:17-23). It is told that, sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he summoned "the presbyters of the Church", and in the course of his charge addressed them as follows: "Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock, wherein the Holy Ghost has placed you bishops to tend [poimainein] the Church of God" (20:28). St. Peter employs similar language: "The presbyters that are among you, I beseech, who am myself also a presbyter . . . tend [poimainein] the flock of God which is among you." These expressions leave no doubt as to the office designated by St. Paul, when in Ephesians 4:11, he enumerates the gifts of the Ascended Lord as follows: "He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors [tous de poimenas kai didaskalous]. The Epistle of St. James provides us with yet another reference to this office, where the sick man is bidden send for the presbyters of the Church, that he may receive at their hands the rite of unction (James 5:14).<br>The term presbyter was of common use in the Jewish Church, as denoting the "rulers" of the synagogue (cf. Luke 13:14). Hence it has been argued by some non-Catholic writers that in the bishops and deacons of the New Testament there is simply the synagogal organization familiar to the first converts, and introduced by them into the Christian communities. St. Paul's concept of the Church, it is urged, is essentially opposed to any rigid governmental system; yet this familiar form of organization was gradually established even in the Churches he had founded. In regard to this view it appears enough to say that the resemblance between the Jewish "rulers of the synagogue" and the Christian presbyter-episcopus goes no farther than the name. The Jewish official was purely civil and held office for a time only. The Christian presbyterate was for life, and its functions were spiritual. There is perhaps more ground for the view advocated by some (cf. de Smedt, Revue des quest. hist., vols. XLIV, L), that presbyter and episcopus may not in all cases be perfectly synonymous. The term presbyter is undoubtedly an honorific title, while that of episcopus primarily indicates the function performed. It is possible that the former title may have had a wider significance than the latter. The designation presbyter, it is suggested, may have been given to all those who were recognized as having a claim to some voice in directing the affairs of the community, whether this were based on official status, or social rank, or benefactions to the local Church, or on some other ground; while those presbyters who had received the laying on of hands would be known, not simply as "presbyters", but as "presiding [proistamenoi — 1 Thessalonians 5:12) presbyters", "presbyter-bishops", "presbyter-rulers" (hegoumenoi — Hebrews 13:17).<br>It remains to consider whether the so-called "monarchical" episcopate was instituted by the Apostles. Besides establishing a college of presbyter-bishops, did they further place one man in a position of supremacy, entrusting the government of the Church to him, and endowing him with Apostolic authority over the Christian community? Even if we take into account the Scriptural evidence alone, there are sufficient grounds for answering this question in the affirmative. From the time of the dispersion of the Apostles, St. James appears in an episcopal relation to the Church of Jerusalem (Acts 12:17; 15:13; Galatians 2:12). In the other Christian communities the institution of "monarchical" bishops was a somewhat later development. At first the Apostles themselves fulfilled, it would seem, all the duties of supreme oversight. They established the office when the growing needs of the Church demanded it. The Pastoral Epistles leave no room to doubt that Timothy and Titus were sent as bishops to Ephesus and to Crete respectively. To Timothy full Apostolic powers are conceded. Notwithstanding his youth he holds authority over both clergy and laity. To him is confided the duty of guarding the purity of the Church's faith, of ordaining priests, of exercising jurisdiction. Moreover, St. Paul's exhortation to him, "to keep the commandment without spot, blameless, unto the coming of our Lord <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>" shows that this was no transitory mission. A charge so worded includes in its sweep, not Timothy alone, but his successors in an office which is to last until the Second Advent. Local tradition unhesitatingly reckoned him among the occupants of the episcopal see. At the Council of Chalcedon, the Church of Ephesus counted a succession of twenty-seven bishops commencing with Timothy (Mansi, VII, 293; cf. Eusebius, Church History III.4-5).<br>These are not the sole evidences which the New Testament affords of the monarchical episcopate. In the Apocalypse the "angels" to whom the letters to the seven Churches are addressed are almost certainly the bishops of the respective communities. Some commentators, indeed, have held them to be personifications of the communities themselves. But this explanation can hardly stand. St. John, throughout, addresses the angel as being responsible for the community precisely as he would address its ruler. Moreover, in the symbolism of chapter 1, the two are represented under different figures: the angels are the stars in the right hand of the Son of Man; the seven candlesticks are the image which figures the communities. The very term angel, it should be noticed, is practically synonymous with apostle, and thus is aptly chosen to designate the episcopal office. Again the messages to Archippus (Colossians 4:17; Philemon 2) imply that he held a position of special dignity, superior to that of the other presbyters. The mention of him in a letter entirely concerned with a private matter, as is that to Philemon, is hardly explicable unless he were the official head of the Colossian Church. We have therefore four important indications of the existence of an office in the local Churches, held by a single person, and carrying with it Apostolical authority. Nor can any difficulty be occasioned by the fact that as yet no special title distinguishes these successors of the Apostles from the ordinary presbyters. It is in the nature of things that the office should exist before a title is assigned to it. The name of apostle, we have seen, was not confined to the Twelve. St. Peter (1 Peter 5:1) and St. John (2 and 3 John 1:1) both speak of themselves as presbyters". St. Paul speaks of the Apostolate as a diakonia. A parallel case in later ecclesiastical history is afforded by the word pope. This title was not appropriated to the exclusive use of the Holy See till the eleventh century. Yet no one maintains that the supreme pontificate of the Roman bishop was not recognized till then. It should cause no surprise that a precise terminology, distinguishing bishops, in the full sense, from the presbyter-bishops, is not found in the New Testament.<br>The conclusion reached is put beyond all reasonable doubt by the testimony of the sub-Apostolic Age. This is so important in regard to the question of the episcopate that it is impossible entirely to pass it over. It will be enough, however, to refer to the evidence contained in the epistles of St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, himself a disciple of the Apostles. In these epistles (about A.D. 107) he again and again asserts that the supremacy of the bishop is of Divine institution and belongs to the Apostolic constitution of the Church. He goes so far as to affirm that the bishop stands in the place of Christ Himself. "When ye are obedient to the bishop as to <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>," he writes to the Trallians, "it is evident to me that ye are living not after men, but after <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>. . . be ye obedient also to the presbytery as to the Apostles of <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>" (Letter to the Trallians 2). He also incidentally tells us that bishops are found in the Church, even in "the farthest parts of the earth" (Letter to the Ephesians 3) It is out of the question that one who lived at a period so little removed from the actual Apostolic Age could have proclaimed this doctrine in terms such as he employs, had not the episcopate been universally recognized as of Divine appointment. It has been seen that Christ not only established the episcopate in the persons of the Twelve but, further, created in St. Peter the office of supreme pastor of the Church. Early Christian history tells us that before his death, he fixed his residence at Rome, and ruled the Church there as its bishop. It is from Rome that he dates his first Epistle, speaking of the city under the name of Babylon, a designation which St. John also gives it in the Apocalypse (c. xviii). At Rome, too, he suffered martyrdom in company with St. Paul, A.D. 67. The list of his successors in the see is known, from Linus, Anacletus, and Clement, who were the first to follow him, down to the reigning pontiff. The Church has ever seen in the occupant of the See of Rome the successor of Peter in the supreme pastorate. (See POPE.)<br>The evidence thus far considered seems to demonstrate beyond all question that the hierarchical organization of the Church was, in its essential elements, the work of the Apostles themselves; and that to this hierarchy they handed on the charge entrusted to them by Christ of governing the Kingdom of God, and of teaching the revealed doctrine. These conclusions are far from being admitted by Protestant and other critics. They are unanimous in holding that the idea of a Church — an organized society — is entirely foreign to the teaching of Christ. It is therefore, in their eyes, impossible that Catholicism, if by that term we signify a worldwide institution, bound together by unity of constitution, of doctrine, and of worship, can have been established by the direct action of the Apostles. In the course of the nineteenth century many theories were propounded to account for the transformation of the so-called "Apostolic Christianity" into the Christianity of the commencement of the third century, when beyond all dispute the Catholic system was firmly established from one end of the Roman Empire to the other. At the present day (1908) the theories advocated by the critics are of a less extravagant nature than those of F.C. Baur (1853) and the Tübingen School, which had so great a vogue in the middle of the nineteenth century. Greater regard is shown for the claims of historical possibility and for the value of early Christian evidences. At the same time it is to be observed that the reconstructions suggested involve the rejection of the Pastoral Epistles as being documents of the second century. It will be sufficient here to notice one or two salient points in the views which now find favour with the best known among non-Catholic writers.<br>
<br>It is held that such official organization as existed in the Christian communities was not regarded as involving special spiritual gifts, and had but little religious significance. Some writers, as has been seen, believe with Holtzmann that in the episcopi and presbyteri, there is simply the synagogal system of archontes and hyperetai. Others, with Hatch, derive the origin of the episcopate from the fact that certain civic functionaries in the Syrian cities appear to have borne the title of "episcopi". Professor Harnack, while agreeing with Hatch as to the origin of the office, differs from him in so far as he admits that from the first the superintendence of worship belonged to the functions of the bishop. The offices of prophet and teacher, it is urged, were those in which the primitive Church acknowledged a spiritual significance. These depended entirely on special charismatic gifts of the Holy Ghost. The government of the Church in matters of religion was thus regarded as a direct Divine rule by the Holy Spirit, acting through His inspired agents. And only gradually, it is supposed, did the local ministry take the place of the prophets and teachers, and inherit from them the authority once attributed to the possessors of spiritual gifts alone (cf. Sabatier, Religions of Authority, p. 24). Even if we prescind altogether from the evidence considered above, this theory appears devoid of intrinsic probability. A direct Divine rule by "charismata" could only result in confusion, if uncontrolled by any directive power possessed of superior authority. Such a directive and regulative authority, to which the exercise of spiritual gifts was itself subject, existed in the Apostolate, as the New Testament amply shows (1 Corinthians 14). In the succeeding age a precisely similar authority is found in the episcopate. Every principle of historical criticism demands that the source of episcopal power should be sought, not in the "charismata", but, where tradition places it, in the Apostolate itself.
<br>It is to the crisis occasioned by Gnosticism and Montanism in the second century that these writers attribute the rise of the Catholic system. They say that, in order to combat these heresies, the Church found it necessary to federate itself, and that for this end it established a statutory, so-called "apostolic" faith, and further secured the episcopal supremacy by the fiction of "apostolic succession", (Harnack, Hist. of Dogma, II, ii; Sabatier, op. cit., pp. 35-59). This view appears to be irreconcilable with the facts of the case. The evidence of the Ignatian epistles alone shows that, long before the Gnostic crisis arose, the particular local Churches were conscious of an essential principle of solidarity binding all together into a single system. Moreover, the very fact that these heresies gained no foothold within the Church in any part of the world, but were everywhere recognized as heretical and promptly excluded, suffices to prove that the Apostolic faith was already clearly known and firmly held, and that the Churches were already organized under an active episcopate. Again, to say that the doctrine of Apostolic succession was invented to cope with these heresies is to overlook the fact that it is asserted in plain terms in the Epistle of Clement 42.
<br>M. Loisy's theory as to the organization of the Church has attracted so much attention in recent years as to call for a brief notice. In his work, "L'Evangile et l'Église", he accepts many of the views held by critics hostile to Catholicism, and endeavours by a doctrine of development to reconcile them with some form of adhesion to the Church. He urges that the Church is of the nature of an organism, whose animating principle is the message of <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>. This organism may experience many changes of external form, as it develops itself in accordance with its inner needs, and with the requirements of its environment. Yet so long as these changes are such as are demanded in order that the vital principle may be preserved, they are unessential in character. So far indeed are they from being organic alterations, that we ought to reckon them as implicitly involved in the very being of the Church. The formation of the hierarchy he regards as a change of this kind. In fact, since he holds that <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a> mistakenly anticipated the end of the world to be close at hand, and that His first disciples lived in expectation of His immediate return in glory, it follows that the hierarchy must have had some such origin as this. It is out of the question to attribute it to the Apostles. Men who believed the end of the world to be impending would not have seen the necessity of endowing a society with a form of government intended to endure.<br>These revolutionary views constitute part of the theory known as Modernism, whose philosophical presuppositions involve the complete denial of the miraculous. The Church, according to this theory, is not a society established by eternal Divine interposition. It is a society expressing the religious experience of the collectivity of consciences, and owing its origin to two natural tendencies in men, viz. the tendency of the individual believer to communicate his beliefs to others, and the tendency of those who hold the same beliefs to unite in a society. The Modernist theories were analyzed and condemned as "the synthesis of all the heresies" in the Encyclical "Pascendi Dominici gregis" (18 September, 1907). The principal features of M. Loisy's theory of the Church had been already included among the condemned propositions contained in the Decree "Lamentabili" (3 July, 1907). The fifty-third of the propositions there singled out for reprobation is the following: "The original constitution of the Church is not immutable; but the Christian society like human society is subject to perpetual change."<br><br>The church, as has been seen, is a society formed of living men, not a mere mystical union of souls. As such it resembles other societies. Like them, it has its code of rules, its executive officers, its ceremonial observances. Yet it differs from them more than it resembles them: for it is a supernatural society. The Kingdom of God is supernatural alike in its origin, in the purpose at which it aims, and in the means at its disposal. Other kingdoms are natural in their origin; and their scope is limited to the temporal welfare of their citizens. The supernatural character of the Church is seen, when its relation to the redemptive work of Christ is considered. It is the society of those whom He has redeemed from the world. The world, by which term are signified men in so far as they have fallen from God, is ever set forth in Scripture as the kingdom of the Evil One. It is the "world of darkness" (Ephesians 6:12), it is "seated in the wicked one" (1 John 5:19), it hates Christ (John 15:18). To save the world, God the Son became man. He offered Himself as a propitiation for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2). God, Who desires that all men should be saved, has offered salvation to all; but the greater part of mankind rejects the proffered gift. The Church is the society of those who accept redemption, of those whom Christ "has chosen out of the world" (John 15:19). Thus it is the Church alone which He "hath purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28). Of the members of the Church, the Apostle can say that "God hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love" (Colossians 1:13). St. Augustine terms the Church "mundus salvatus" — the redeemed world — and speaking of the enmity borne towards the Church by those who reject her, says: "The world of perdition hates the world of salvation" (Tractate 80 on the Gospel of John, no. 2). To the Church Christ has given the means of grace He merited by His life and death. She communicates them to her members; and those who are outside her fold she bids to enter that they too may participate in them. By these means of grace — the light of revealed truth, the sacraments, the perpetual renewal of the Sacrifice of Calvary — the Church carries on the work of sanctifying the elect. Through their instrumentality each individual soul is perfected, and conformed to the likeness of the Son of God.<br>It is thus manifest that, when we regard the Church simply as the society of disciples, we are considering its external form only. Its inward life is found in the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, the gifts of faith, hope, and charity, the grace communicated by the sacraments, and the other prerogatives by which the children of God differ from the children of the world. This aspect of the Church is described by the Apostles in figurative language. They represent it as the Body of Christ, the Spouse of Christ, the Temple of God. In order to understand its true nature some consideration of these comparisons is requisite. In the conception of the Church as a body governed and directed by Christ as the head, far more is contained than the familiar analogy between a ruler and his subjects on the one hand, and the head guiding and coordinating the activities of the several members on the other. That analogy expresses indeed the variety of function, the unity of directive principle, and the cooperation of the parts to a common end, which are found in a society; but it is insufficient to explain the terms in which St. Paul speaks of the union between Christ and His disciples. Each of them is a member of Christ (1 Corinthians 6:15); together they form the body of Christ (Ephesians 4:16); as a corporate unity they are simply termed Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12).<br>The intimacy of union here suggested is, however, justified, if we recall that the gifts and graces bestowed upon each disciple are graces merited by the Passion of Christ, and are destined to produce in him the likeness of Christ. The connection between Christ and himself is thus very different from the purely juridical relation binding the ruler of a natural society to the individuals belonging to it. The Apostle develops the relation between Christ and His members from various points of view. As a human body is organized, each joint and muscle having its own function, yet each contributing to the union of the complex whole, so too the Christian society is a body "compacted and firmly joined together by that which every part supplieth" (Ephesians 4:16), while all the parts depend on Christ their head. It is He Who has organized the body, assigning to each member his place in the Church, endowing each with the special graces necessary, and, above all, conferring on some of the members the graces in virtue of which they rule and guide the Church in His name (4:11). Strengthened by these graces, the mystical body, like a physical body, grows and increases. This growth is twofold. It takes place in the individual, inasmuch as each Christian gradually grows into the "perfect man", into the image of Christ (Ephesians 4:13, 15; Romans 8:29). But there is also a growth in the whole body. As time goes on, the Church is to increase and multiply till it fills the earth. So intimate is the union between Christ and His members, that the Apostle speaks of the Church as the "fullness" (pleroma) of Christ (Ephesians 1:23; 4:13), as though apart from His members something were lacking to the head. He even speaks of it as Christ: "As all the members of the body whereas they are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ" (1 Corinthians 12:12). And to establish the reality of this union he refers it to the efficacious instrumentality of the Holy Eucharist: "We being many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of that one bread" (1 Corinthians 10:17 — Greek text).<br>The description of the Church as God's temple, in which the disciples are "living stones" (1 Peter 2:5), is scarcely less frequent in the Apostolic writings than is the metaphor of the body. "You are the temple of the living God" (2 Corinthians 6:16), writes St. Paul to the Corinthians, and he reminds the Ephesians that they are "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a> himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building being framed together, groweth up into a holy temple in the Lord" (Ephesians 2:20 sq.). With a slight change in the metaphor, the same Apostle in another passage (1 Corinthians 3:11) compares Christ to the foundation, and himself and other Apostolic labourers to the builders who raise the temple upon it. It is noticeable that the word translated "temple" is naos, a term which signifies properly the inner sanctuary. The Apostle, when he employs this word, is clearly comparing the Christian Church to that Holy of Holies where God manifested His visible presence in the Shekinah. The metaphor of the temple is well adapted to enforce two lessons. On several occasions the Apostle employs it to impress on his readers the sanctity of the Church in which they have been incorporated. "If any shall violate the temple of God", he says, speaking of those who corrupt the Church by false doctrine, "him shall God destroy" (1 Corinthians 3:17). And he employs the same motive to dissuade disciples from forming matrimonial alliance with Unbelievers: "What agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God" (2 Corinthians 6:16). It further illustrates in the clearest way the truth that to each member of the Church God has assigned his own place, enabling him by his work there to cooperate towards the great common end, the glory of God.<br>The third parallel represents the Church as the bride of Christ. Here there is much more than a metaphor. The Apostle says that the union between Christ and His Church is the archetype of which human marriage is an earthly representation. Thus he bids wives be subject to their husbands, as the Church is subject to Christ (Ephesians 5:22 sq.). Yet he points out on the other hand that the relation of husband to wife is not that of a master to his servant, but one involving the tenderest and most self-sacrificing love. He bids husbands love their wives, "as Christ also loved the Church, and delivered himself up for it" (Ephesians 5:25). Man and wife are one flesh; and in this the husband has a powerful motive for love towards the wife, since "no man ever hated his own flesh". This physical union is but the antitype of that mysterious bond in virtue of which the Church is so truly one with Christ, that "we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 'For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh'" (Ephesians 5:30 sq.; Genesis 2:24). In these words the Apostle indicates the mysterious parallelism between the union of the first Adam with the spouse formed from his body, and the union of the second Adam with the Church. She is "bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh", even as Eve was in regard to our first father. And those only belong to the family of the second Adam, who are her children, "born again of water and of the Holy Ghost". Occasionally the metaphor assumes a slightly different form. In Apocalypse 19:7, the marriage of the Lamb to his spouse the Church does not take place till the last day in the hour of the Church's final triumph. Thus too St. Paul, writing to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11:2), compares himself to "the friend of the bridegroom", who played so important a part in the Hebrew marriage ceremony (cf. John 3:29). He has, he says, espoused the Corinthian community to Christ, and he holds himself responsible to present it spotless to the bridegroom.<br>Through the medium of these metaphors the Apostles set forth the inward nature of the Church. Their expressions leave no doubt that in them they always refer to the actually existing Church founded by Christ on earth — the society of Christ's disciples. Hence it is instructive to observe that Protestant divines find it necessary to distinguish between an actual and an ideal Church, and to assert that the teaching of the Apostles regarding the Spouse, the Temple, and the Body refers to the ideal Church alone (cf. Gayford in Hastings, "Dict. of the Bible", s.v. Church).<br><br>In the preceding examination of the Scriptural doctrine regarding the Church, it has been seen how clearly it is laid down that only by entering the Church can we participate in the redemption wrought for us by Christ. Incorporation with the Church can alone unite us to the family of the second Adam, and alone can engraft us into the true Vine. Moreover, it is to the Church that Christ has committed those means of grace through which the gifts He earned for men are communicated to them. The Church alone dispenses the sacraments. It alone makes known the light of revealed truth. Outside the Church these gifts cannot be obtained. From all this there is but one conclusion: Union with the Church is not merely one out of various means by which salvation may be obtained: it is the only means.<br>This doctrine of the absolute necessity of union with the Church was taught in explicit terms by Christ. Baptism, the act of incorporation among her members, He affirmed to be essential to salvation. "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved: he that believeth not shall be condemned" (Mark 16:16). Any disciple who shall throw off obedience to the Church is to be reckoned as one of the heathen: he has no part in the Kingdom of God (Matthew 18:17). St. Paul is equally explicit. "A man that is a heretic", he writes to Titus, "after the first and second admonition avoid, knowing that he that is such a one is . . . condemned by his own judgment" (Titus 3:10 sq.). The doctrine is summed up in the phrase, Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus. This saying has been the occasion of so many objections that some consideration of its meaning seems desirable. It certainly does not mean that none can be saved except those who are in visible communion with the Church. The Catholic Church has ever taught that nothing else is needed to obtain justification than an act of perfect charity and of contrition. Whoever, under the impulse of actual grace, elicits these acts receives immediately the gift of sanctifying grace, and is numbered among the children of God. Should he die in these dispositions, he will assuredly attain heaven. It is true such acts could not possibly be elicited by one who was aware that God has commanded all to join the Church, and who nevertheless should willfully remain outside her fold. For love of God carries with it the practical desire to fulfill His commandments. But of those who die without visible communion with the Church, not all are guilty of willful disobedience to God's commands. Many are kept from the Church by ignorance. Such may be the case of numbers among those who have been brought up in heresy. To others the external means of grace may be unattainable. Thus an excommunicated person may have no opportunity of seeking reconciliation at the last, and yet may repair his faults by inward acts of contrition and charity.<br>It should be observed that those who are thus saved are not entirely outside the pale of the Church. The will to fulfill all God's commandments is, and must be, present in all of them. Such a wish implicitly includes the desire for incorporation with the visible Church: for this, though they know it not, has been commanded by God. They thus belong to the Church by desire (voto). Moreover, there is a true sense in which they may be said to be saved through the Church. In the order of Divine Providence, salvation is given to man in the Church: membership in the Church Triumphant is given through membership in the Church Militant. Sanctifying grace, the title to salvation, is peculiarly the grace of those who are united to Christ in the Church: it is the birthright of the children of God. The primary purpose of those actual graces which God bestows upon those outside the Church is to draw them within the fold. Thus, even in the case in which God saves men apart from the Church, He does so through the Church's graces. They are joined to the Church in spiritual communion, though not in visible and external communion. In the expression of theologians, they belong to the soul of the Church, though not to its body. Yet the possibility of salvation apart from visible communion with the Church must not blind us to the loss suffered by those who are thus situated. They are cut off from the sacraments God has given as the support of the soul. In the ordinary channels of grace, which are ever open to the faithful Catholic, they cannot participate. Countless means of sanctification which the Church offers are denied to them. It is often urged that this is a stern and narrow doctrine. The reply to this objection is that the doctrine is stern, but only in the sense in which sternness is inseparable from love. It is the same sternness which we find in Christ's words, when he said: "If you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin" (John 8:24). The Church is animated with the spirit of Christ; she is filled with the same love for souls, the same desire for their salvation. Since, then, she knows that the way of salvation is through union with her, that in her and in her alone are stored the benefits of the Passion, she must needs be uncompromising and even stern in the assertion of her claims. To fail here would be to fail in the duty entrusted to her by her Lord. Even where the message is unwelcome, she must deliver it.<br>It is instructive to observe that this doctrine has been proclaimed at every period of the Church's history. It is no accretion of a later age. The earliest successors of the Apostles speak as plainly as the medieval theologians, and the medieval theologians are not more emphatic than those of today. From the first century to the twentieth there is absolute unanimity. St. Ignatius of Antioch writes: "Be not deceived, my brethren. If any man followeth one that maketh schism, he doth not inherit the kingdom of God. If any one walketh in strange doctrine, he hath no fellowship with the Passion" (Philadelphians 3). Origen says: "Let no man deceive himself. Outside this house, i.e. outside the Church, none is saved" (Hom. in Jos., iii, n. 5 in P.G., XII, 841). St. Cyprian speaks to the same effect: "He cannot have God for his father, who has not the Church for his mother" (Treatise on Unity 6). The words of the Fourth Ecumenical Council of the Lateran (1215) define the doctrine thus in its decree against the Albigenses: "Una est fidelium universalis Ecclesia, extra quam nullus omnino salvatur" (Denzinger, n. 357); and Pius IX employed almost identical language in his Encyclical to the bishops of Italy (10 August, 1863): "Notissimum est catholicum dogma neminem scilicet extra catholicam ecclesiam posse salvari" (Denzinger, n. 1529).<br><br>In asserting that the Church of Christ is visible, we signify, first, that as a society it will at all times be conspicuous and public, and second, that it will ever be recognizable among other bodies as the Church of Christ. These two aspects of visibility are termed respectively "material" and "formal" visibility by Catholic theologians. The material visibility of the Church involves no more than that it must ever be a public, not a private profession; a society manifest to the world, not a body whose members are bound by some secret tie. Formal visibility is more than this. It implies that in all ages the true Church of Christ will be easily recognizable for that which it is, viz. as the Divine society of the Son of God, the means of salvation offered by God to men; that it possesses certain attributes which so evidently postulate a Divine origin that all who see it must know it comes from God. This must, of course, be understood with some necessary qualifications. The power to recognize the Church for what it is presupposes certain moral dispositions. Where there is a rooted unwillingness to follow God's will, there may be spiritual blindness to the claims of the Church. Invincible prejudice or inherited assumptions may produce the same result. But in such cases the incapacity to see is due, not to the want of visibility in the Church, but to the blindness of the individual. The case bears an almost exact analogy to the evidence possessed by the proofs for the existence of God. The proofs in themselves are evident: but they may fail to penetrate a mind obscured by prejudice or ill will. From the time of the Reformation, Protestant writers either denied the visibility of the Church, or so explained it as to rob it of most of its meaning. After briefly indicating the grounds of the Catholic doctrine, some views prevalent on this subject among Protestant authorities will be noticed.<br>It is unnecessary to say more in regard to the material visibility of the Church than has been said in sections III and IV of this article. It has been shown there that Christ established His Church as an organized society under accredited leaders, and that He commanded its rulers and those who should succeed them to summon all men to secure their eternal salvation by entry into it. It is manifest that there is no question here of a secret union of believers: the Church is a worldwide corporation, whose existence is to be forced upon the notice of all, willing or unwilling. Formal visibility is secured by those attributes which are usually termed the "notes" of the Church — her Unity, Sanctity, Catholicity, and Apostolicity (see below). The proof may be illustrated in the case of the first of these. The unity of the Church stands out as a fact altogether unparalleled in human history. Her members all over the world are united by the profession of a common faith, by participation in a common worship, and by obedience to a common authority. Differences of class, of nationality, and of race, which seem as though they must be fatal to any form of union, cannot sever this bond. It links in one the civilized and the uncivilized, the philosopher and the peasant, the rich and the poor. One and all hold the same belief, join in the same religious ceremonies, and acknowledge in the successor of Peter the same supreme ruler. Nothing but a supernatural power can explain this. It is a proof manifest to all minds, even to the simple and the unlettered, that the Church is a Divine society. Without this formal visibility, the purpose for which the Church was founded would be frustrated. Christ established it to be the means of salvation for all mankind. For this end it is essential that its claims should be authenticated in a manner evident to all; in other words, it must be visible, not merely as other public societies are visible, but as being the society of the Son of God.<br>The views taken by Protestants as to the visibility of the Church are various. The rationalist critics naturally reject the whole conception. To them the religion preached by <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a> was something purely internal. When the Church as an institution came to be regarded as an indispensable factor in religion, it was a corruption of the primitive message. (See Harnack, What is Christianity, p. 213.) Passages which deal with the Church in her corporate unity are referred by writers of this school to an ideal invisible Church, a mystical communion of souls. Such an interpretation does violence to the sense of the passages. Moreover, no explanation possessing any semblance of probability has yet been given to account for the genesis among the disciples of this remarkable and altogether novel conception of an invisible Church. It may reasonably be demanded of a professedly critical school that this phenomenon should be explained. Harnack holds that it took the place of Jewish racial unity. But it does not appear why Gentile converts should have felt the need of replacing a feature so entirely proper to the Hebrew religion.<br>The doctrine of the older Protestant writers is that there are two Churches, a visible and an invisible. This is the view of such standard Anglican divines as Barrow, Field, and Jeremy Taylor (see e.g. Barrow, Unity of Church, Works, 1830, VII, 628). Those who thus explain visibility urge that the essential and vital element of membership in Christ lies in an inner union with Him; that this is necessarily invisible, and those who possess it constitute an invisible Church. Those who are united to Him externally alone have, they maintain, no part in His grace. Thus, when He promised to His Church the gift of indefectibility, declaring that the gates of hell should never prevail against it, the promise must be understood of the invisible, not of the visible Church. In regard to this theory, which is still tolerably prevalent, it is to be said that Christ's promises were made to the Church as a corporate body, as constituting a society. As thus understood, they were made to the visible Church, not to an invisible and unknown body. Indeed for this distinction between a visible and an invisible Church there is no Scriptural warrant. Even though many of her children prove unfaithful, yet all that Christ said in regard to the Church is realized in her as a corporate body. Nor does the unfaithfulness of these professing Catholics cut them off altogether from membership in Christ. They are His in virtue of their baptism. The character then received still stamps them as His. Though dry and withered branches they are not altogether broken off from the true Vine (Bellarmine, De Ecciesiâ, III, ix, 13). The Anglican High Church writers explicitly teach the visibility of the Church. They restrict themselves, however, to the consideration of material visibility (cf. Palmer, Treatise on the Church, Part I, C. iii).<br>The doctrine of the visibility in no way excludes from the Church those who have already attained to bliss. These are united with the members of the Church Militant in one communion of <a data-href="saint" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Saints/saint.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">saint</a>s. They watch her struggles; their prayers are offered on her behalf. Similarly, those who are still in the cleansing fires of purgatory belong to the Church. There are not, as has been said, two Churches; there is but one Church, and of it all the souls of the just, whether in heaven, on earth, or in purgatory, are members (Catech. Rom., I, x, 6). But it is to the Church only in so far as militant here below — to the Church among men — that the property of visibility belongs.<br><br>Whatever authority is exercised in the Church, is exercised in virtue of the commission of Christ. He is the one Prophet, Who has given to the world the revelation of truth, and by His spirit preserves in the Church the faith once delivered to the <a data-href="saint" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Saints/saint.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">saint</a>s. He is the one Priest, ever pleading on behalf of the Church the sacrifice of Calvary. And He is the one King — the chief Shepherd (1 Peter 5:4) — Who rules and guides, through His Providence, His Church's course. Yet He wills to exercise His power through earthly representatives. He chose the Twelve, and charged them in His name to teach the nations (Matthew 28:19), to offer sacrifice (Luke 22:19), to govern His flock (Matthew 18:18; John 21:17). They, as seen above, used the authority committed to them while they lived; and before their death, they took measures for the perpetuation of this principle of government in the Church. From that day to this, the hierarchy thus established has claimed and has exercised this threefold office. Thus the prophecies of the Old Testament have been fulfilled which foretold that to those who should be appointed to rule the Messianic kingdom it should be granted to participate in the Messias' office of prophet, priest, and king. (See II above.)<br>The authority established in the Church holds its commission from above, not from below. The pope and the bishops exercise their power as the successors of the men who were chosen by Christ in person. They are not, as the Presbyterian theory of Church government teaches, the delegates of the flock; their warrant is received from the Shepherd, not from the sheep. The view that ecclesiastical authority is ministerial only, and derived by delegation from the faithful, was expressly condemned by Pius VI (1794) in his Constitution "Auctorem Fidei"; and on the renovation of the error by certain recent Modernist writers, Pius X reiterated the condemnation in the Encyclical on the errors of the Modernists. In this sense the government of the Church is not democratic. This indeed is involved in the very nature of the Church as a supernatural society, leading men to a supernatural end. No man is capable of wielding authority for such a purpose, unless power is communicated to him from a Divine source. The case is altogether different where civil society is concerned. There the end is not supernatural: it is the temporal well-being of the citizens. It cannot then be said that a special endowment is required to render any class of men capable of filling the place of rulers and of guides. Hence the Church approves equally all forms of civil government which are consonant with the principle of justice. The power exercised by the Church through sacrifice and sacrament (potestas ordinis) lies outside the present subject. It is proposed briefly to consider here the nature of the Church's authority in her office (1) of teaching (potestas magisterii) and (2) of government (potestas jurisdictionis).<br><br>As the Divinely appointed teacher of revealed truth, the Church is infallible. This gift of inerrancy is guaranteed to it by the words of Christ, in which He promised that His Spirit would abide with it forever to guide it unto all truth (John 14:16; 16:13). It is implied also in other passages of Scripture, and asserted by the unanimous testimony of the Fathers. The scope of this infallibility is to preserve the deposit of faith revealed to man by Christ and His Apostles (see INFALLIBILITY.) The Church teaches expressly that it is the guardian only of the revelation, that it can teach nothing which it has not received. The Vatican Council declares: "The Holy Ghost was not promised to the successors of Peter, in order that through His revelation they might manifest new doctrine: but that through His assistance they might religiously guard, and faithfully expound the revelation handed down by the Apostles, or the deposit of the faith" (Conc. Vat., Sess. IV, cap. liv). The obligation of the natural moral law constitutes part of this revelation. The authority of that law is again and again insisted on by Christ and His Apostles. The Church therefore is infallible in matters both of faith and morals. Moreover, theologians are agreed that the gift of infallibility in regard to the deposit must, by necessary consequence, carry with it infallibility as to certain matters intimately related to the Faith. There are questions bearing so nearly on the preservation of the Faith that, could the Church err in these, her infallibility would not suffice to guard the flock from false doctrine. Such, for instance, is the decision whether a given book does or does not contain teaching condemned as heretical. (See DOGMATIC FACTS.)<br>It is needless to point out that if the Christian Faith is indeed a revealed doctrine, which men must believe under pain of eternal loss, the gift of infallibility was necessary to the Church. Could she err at all, she might err in any point. The flock would have no guarantee of the truth of any doctrine. The condition of those bodies which at the time of the Reformation forsook the Church affords us an object-lesson in point. Divided into various sections and parties, they are the scene of never-ending disputes; and by the nature of the case they are cut off from all hope of attaining to certainty. In regard also to the moral law, the need of an infallible guide is hardly less imperative. Though on a few broad principles there may be some consensus of opinion as to what is right and what is wrong, yet, in the application of these principles to concrete facts, it is impossible to obtain agreement. On matters of such practical moment as are, for instance, the questions of private property, marriage, and liberty, the most divergent views are defended by thinkers of great ability. Amid all this questioning the unerring voice of the Church gives confidence to her children that they are following the right course, and have not been led astray by some specious fallacy. The various modes in which the Church exercises this gift, and the prerogatives of the Holy See in regard to infallibility, will be found discussed in the article dealing with that subject.<br><br>The Church's pastors govern and direct the flock committed to them in virtue of jurisdiction conferred upon them by Christ. The authority of jurisdiction differs essentially from the authority to teach. The two powers are concerned with different objects. The right to teach is concerned solely with the manifestation of the revealed doctrine; the object of the power of jurisdiction is to establish and enforce such laws and regulations as are necessary to the well-being of the Church. Further, the right of the Church to teach extends to the whole world: The jurisdiction of her rulers extends to her members alone (1 Corinthians 5:12). Christ's words to St. Peter, "I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven", distinctly express the gift of jurisdiction. Supreme authority over a body carries with it the right to govern and direct. The three elements which go to constitute jurisdiction — legislative power, judicial power, and coercive power — are, moreover, all implied in Christ's directions to the Apostles (Matthew 18). Not merely are they instructed to impose obligations and to settle disputes; but they may even inflict the extremest ecclesiastical penalty — that of exclusion from membership in Christ.<br>The jurisdiction exercised within the Church is partly of Divine right, and partly determined by ecclesiastical law. A supreme jurisdiction over the whole Church — clergy and laity alike — belongs by Divine appointment to the pope (Conc. Vat, Sess. IV, cap. iii). The government of the faithful by bishops possessed of ordinary jurisdiction (i.e. a jurisdiction that is not held by mere delegation, but is exercised in their own name) is likewise of Divine ordinance. But the system by which the Church is territorially divided into dioceses, within each of which a single bishop rules the faithful within that district, is an ecclesiastical arrangement capable of modification. The limits of dioceses may be changed by the Holy See. In England the old pre-Reformation diocesan divisions held good until 1850, though the Catholic hierarchy had become extinct in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In that year the old divisions were annulled and a new diocesan system established. Similarly in France, a complete change was introduced after the Revolution. A bishop may exercise his power on other than a territorial basis. Thus in the East there are different bishops for the faithful belonging to the different rites in communion with the Holy See. Besides bishops, in countries where the ecclesiastical system is fully developed, those of the lower clergy who are <a data-href="parish" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Parish/parish.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">parish</a> priests, in the proper sense of the term, have ordinary jurisdiction within their own parishes.<br>Internal jurisdiction is that which is exercised in the tribunal of penance. It differs from the external jurisdiction of which we have been speaking in that its object is the welfare of the individual penitent, while the object of external jurisdiction is the welfare of the Church as a corporate body. To exercise this internal jurisdiction, the power of orders is an essential condition: none but a priest can absolve. But the power of orders itself is insufficient. The minister of the sacrament must receive jurisdiction from one competent to bestow it. Hence a priest cannot hear confessions in any locality unless he has received faculties from the ordinary of the place. On the other hand, for the exercise of external jurisdiction the power of orders is not necessary. A bishop, duly appointed to a see, but not yet consecrated, is invested with external jurisdiction over his diocese as soon as he has exhibited his letters of appointment to the chapter.<br><br>The foregoing account of the Church and of the principle of authority by which it is governed enables us to determine who are members of the Church and who are not. The membership of which we speak, is incorporation in the visible body of Christ. It has already been noted (VI) that a member of the Church may have forfeited the grace of God. In this case he is a withered branch of the true Vine; but he has not been finally broken off from it. He still belongs to Christ. Three conditions are requisite for a man to be a member of the Church.<br>
<br>In the first place, he must profess the true Faith, and have received the Sacrament of Baptism. The essential necessity of this condition is apparent from the fact that the Church is the kingdom of truth, the society of those who accept the revelation of the Son of God. Every member of the Church must accept the whole revelation, either explicitly or implicitly, by profession of all that the Church teaches. He who refuses to receive it, or who, having received it, falls away, thereby excludes himself from the kingdom (Titus 3:10 sq.). The Sacrament of Baptism is rightly regarded as part of this condition. By it those who profess the Faith are formally adopted as children of God (Ephesians 1:13), and an habitual faith is among the gifts bestowed in it. Christ expressly connects the two, declaring that "he who believeth and is baptized shall be saved" (Mark 16:16; cf. Matthew 28:19).
<br>It is further necessary to acknowledge the authority of the Church and of her appointed rulers. Those who reject the jurisdiction established by Christ are no longer members of His kingdom. Thus St. Ignatius lays it down in his Letter to the Church of Smyrna (no. 8): Wheresoever the bishop shall appear, there let the people be; even as where Jesus may be there is the universal Church". In regard to this condition, the ultimate touchstone is to be found in communion with the Holy See. On Peter Christ founded his Church. Those who are not joined to that foundation cannot form part of the house of God.
<br>The third condition lies in the canonical right to communion with the Church. In virtue of its coercive power the Church has authority to excommunicate notorious sinners. It may inflict this punishment not merely on the ground of heresy or schism, but for other grave offences. Thus St. Paul pronounces sentence of excommunication on the incestuous Corinthian (1 Corinthians 5:3). This penalty is no mere external severance from the rights of common worship. It is a severance from the body of Christ, undoing to this extent the work of baptism, and placing the excommunicated man in the condition of the heathen and the publican". It casts him out of God's kingdom; and the Apostle speaks of it as "delivering him over to Satan" (1 Corinthians 5:5; 1 Timothy 1:20).
<br>Regarding each of these conditions, however, certain distinctions must be drawn.<br>
<br>Many baptized heretics have been educated in their erroneous beliefs. Their case is altogether different from that of those who have voluntarily renounced the Faith. They accept what they believe to be the Divine revelation. Such as these belong to the Church in desire, for they are at heart anxious to fulfill God's will in their regard. In virtue of their baptism and good will, they may be in a state of grace. They belong to the soul of the Church, though they are not united to the visible body. As such they are members of the Church internally, though not externally. Even in regard to those who have themselves fallen away from the Faith, a difference must be made between open and notorious heretics on the one hand, and secret heretics on the other. Open and notorious heresy severs from the visible Church. The majority of theologians agree with Bellarmine (de Ecclesiâ, III, c. x), as against Francisco Suárez, that secret heresy has not this effect.
<br>In regard to schism the same distinction must be drawn. A secret repudiation of the Church's authority does not sever the sinner from the Church. The Church recognizes the schismatic as a member, entitled to her communion, until by open and notorious rebellion he rejects her authority.
<br>Excommunicated persons are either excommunicati tolerati (i.e. those who are still tolerated) or excommunicati vitandi (i.e. those to be shunned). Many theologians hold that those whom the Church still tolerates are not wholly cut off from her membership, and that it is only those whom she has branded as "to be shunned" who are cut off from God's kingdom (see Murray, De Eccles., Disp. i, sect. viii, n. 118). (See EXCOMMUNICATION.)
<br><br>Among the prerogatives conferred on His Church by Christ is the gift of indefectibility. By this term is signified, not merely that the Church will persist to the end of time, but further, that it will preserve unimpaired its essential characteristics. The Church can never undergo any constitutional change which will make it, as a social organism, something different from what it was originally. It can never become corrupt in faith or in morals; nor can it ever lose the Apostolic hierarchy, or the sacraments through which Christ communicates grace to men. The gift of indefectibility is expressly promised to the Church by Christ, in the words in which He declares that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. It is manifest that, could the storms which the Church encounters so shake it as to alter its essential characteristics and make it other than Christ intended it to be, the gates of hell, i.e. the powers of evil, would have prevailed. It is clear, too, that could the Church suffer substantial change, it would no longer be an instrument capable of accomplishing the work for which God called it in to being. He established it that it might be to all men the school of holiness. This it would cease to be if ever it could set up a false and corrupt moral standard. He established it to proclaim His revelation to the world, and charged it to warn all men that unless they accepted that message they must perish everlastingly. Could the Church, in defining the truths of revelation err in the smallest point, such a charge would be impossible. No body could enforce under such a penalty the acceptance of what might be erroneous. By the hierarchy and the sacraments, Christ, further, made the Church the depositary of the graces of the Passion. Were it to lose either of these, it could no longer dispense to men the treasures of grace.<br>The gift of indefectibility plainly does not guarantee each several part of the Church against heresy or apostasy. The promise is made to the corporate body. Individual Churches may become corrupt in morals, may fall into heresy, may even apostatize. Thus at the time of the Mohammedan conquests, whole populations renounced their faith; and the Church suffered similar losses in the sixteenth century. But the defection of isolated branches does not alter the character of the main stem. The society of <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a> remains endowed with all the prerogatives bestowed on it by its Founder. Only to One particular Church is indefectibility assured, viz. to the See of Rome. To Peter, and in him to all his successors in the chief pastorate, Christ committed the task of confirming his brethren in the Faith (Luke 22:32); and thus, to the Roman Church, as Cyprian says, "faithlessness cannot gain access" (Epistle 54). The various bodies that have left the Church naturally deny its indefectibility. Their plea for separation rests in each case on the supposed fact that the main body of Christians has fallen so far from primitive truth, or from the purity of Christian morals, that the formation of a separate organization is not only desirable but necessary. Those who are called on to defend this plea endeavour in various ways to reconcile it with Christ's promise. Some, as seen above (VII), have recourse to the hypothesis of an indefectible invisible Church. The Right Rev. Charles Gore of Worcester, who may be regarded as the representative of high-class Anglicanism, prefers a different solution. In his controversy with Canon Richardson, he adopted the position that while the Church will never fail to teach the whole truth as revealed, yet "errors of addition" may exist universally in its current teaching (see Richardson, Catholic Claims, Appendix). Such an explanation deprives Christ's words of all their meaning. A Church which at any period might conceivably teach, as of faith, doctrines which form no part of the deposit could never deliver her message to the world as the message of God. Men could reasonably urge in regard to any doctrine that it might be an "error of addition".<br>It was said above that one part of the Church's gift of indefectibility lies in her preservation from any substantial corruption in the sphere of morals. This supposes, not merely that she will always proclaim the perfect standard of morality bequeathed to her by her Founder, but also that in every age the lives of many of her children will be based on that sublime model. Only a supernatural principle of spiritual life could bring this about. Man's natural tendency is downwards. The force of every religious movement gradually spends itself; and the followers of great religious reformers tend in time to the level of their environment. According to the laws of unassisted human nature, it should have been thus with the society established by Christ. Yet history shows us that the Catholic Church possesses a power of reform from within, which has no parallel in any other religious organization. Again and again she produces <a data-href="saint" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Saints/saint.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">saint</a>s, men imitating the virtues of Christ in an extraordinary degree, whose influence, spreading far and wide, gives fresh ardour even to those who reach a less heroic standard. Thus, to cite one or two well-known instances out of many that might be given: St. Dominic and St. Francis of Assisi rekindled the love of virtue in the men of the thirteenth century; St. Philip Neri and St. Ignatius Loyola accomplished a like work in the sixteenth century; St. Paul of the Cross and St. Alphonsus Liguori, in the eighteenth. No explanation suffices to account for this phenomenon save the Catholic doctrine that the Church is not a natural but a supernatural society, that the preservation of her moral life depends, not on any laws of human nature, but on the life-giving presence of the Holy Ghost. The Catholic and the Protestant principles of reform stand in sharp contrast the one to the other. Catholic reformers have one and all fallen back on the model set before them in the person of Christ and on the power of the Holy Ghost to breathe fresh life into the souls which He has regenerated. Protestant reformers have commenced their work by separation, and by this act have severed themselves from the very principle of life. No one of course would wish to deny that within the Protestant bodies there have been many men of great virtues. Yet it is not too much to assert that in every case their virtue has been nourished on what yet remained to them of Catholic belief and practice, and not on anything which they have received from Protestantism as such.<br><br>The doctrine of the Church's indefectibility just considered will place us in a position to estimate, at its true value, the claim of the Anglican Church and of the Episcopalian bodies in other English-speaking countries to be continuous with the ancient pre-Reformation Church of England, in the sense of being part of one and the same society. The point to be determined here is what constitutes a breach of continuity as regards a society. It may safely be said that the continuity of a society is broken when a radical change in the principles it embodies is introduced. In the case of a Church, such a change in its hierarchical constitution and in its professed faith suffices to make it a different Church from what it was before. For the societies we term Churches exist as the embodiment of certain supernatural dogmas and of a Divinely-authorized principle of government. when, therefore, the truths previously field to be of faith are rejected, and the principle of government regarded as sacred is repudiated, there is a breach of continuity, and a new Church is formed. In this the continuity of a Church differs from the continuity of a nation. National continuity is independent of forms of government and of beliefs. A nation is an aggregate of families, and so long as these families constitute a self-sufficing social organism, it remains the same nation, whatever the form of government may be. The continuity of a Church depends essentially on its government and its beliefs.<br>The changes introduced into the English Church at the time of the Reformation were precisely of the character just described. At that period fundamental alterations were made in its hierarchical constitution and in its dogmatic standards. It is not to be determined here which was in the right, the Church of Catholic days or the Reformed Church. It is sufficient if we show that changes were made vitally affecting the nature of the society. It is notorious that from the days of Augustine to those of Warham, every archbishop of Canterbury recognized the pope as the supreme source of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The archbishops themselves could not exercise jurisdiction within their province until they had received papal confirmation. Further, the popes were accustomed to send to England legates a latere, who, in virtue of their legatine authority, whatever their personal status in the hierarchy, possessed a jurisdiction superior to that of the local bishops. Appeals ran from every ecclesiastical court in England to the pope, and his decision was recognized by all as final. The pope, too, exercised the right of excommunication in regard to the members of the English Church. This supreme authority was, moreover, regarded by all as belonging to the pope by Divine right, and not in virtue of merely human institution. When, therefore, this power of jurisdiction was transferred to the king, the alteration touched the constitutive principles of the body and was fundamental in its character. Similarly, in regard to matters of faith, the changes were revolutionary. It will be sufficient to note that a new rule of faith was introduced, Scripture alone being substituted for Scripture and Tradition; that several books were expunged from the Canon of Scripture; that five out of the seven sacraments were repudiated; and that the sacrifices of Masses were declared to be "blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits". It is indeed sometimes said that the official formularies of Anglicanism are capable of a Catholic sense, if given a "non-natural" interpretation. This argument can, however, carry no weight. In estimating the character of a society, we must judge, not by the strained sense which some individuals may attach to its formularies, but by the sense they were intended to bear. Judged by this criterion, none can dispute that these innovations were such as to constitute a fundamental change in the dogmatic standpoint of the Church of England.<br><br>The Church of Christ has from the first claimed to transcend all those national differences which divide men. In it, the Apostle asserts, "there is neither Gentile nor Jew . . . Barbarian nor Scythian" (Colossians 3:11). Men of every race are one in it; they form a single brotherhood in the Kingdom of God. In the pagan world, religion and nationality had been coterminous. The boundaries of the State were the boundaries of the faith which the State professed. Even the Jewish Dispensation was limited to a special race. Previous to the Christian revelation the idea of a religion adapted to all peoples was foreign to the conceptions of men. It is one of the essential features of the Church that she should be a single, worldwide society embracing all races. In it, and in it alone, is the brotherhood of man realized. All national barriers, no less than all differences of class, disappear in the City of God. It is not to be understood that the Church disregards the ties which bind men to their country, or undervalues the virtue of patriotism. The division of men into different nations enters into the scheme of Providence. To each nation has been assigned a special task to accomplish in the working out of God's purposes. A man owes a duty to his nation no less than to his family. One who omits this duty has failed in a primary moral obligation. Moreover, each nation has its own character, and its own special gifts. It will usually be found that a man attains to high virtue, not by neglecting these gifts, but by embodying the best and noblest ideals of his own people.<br>For these reasons the Church consecrates the spirit of nationality. Yet it transcends it, for it binds together the various nationalities in a single brotherhood. More than this, it purifies, develops, and perfects national character, just as it purifies and perfects the character of each individual. Often indeed it has been accused of exercising an anti-patriotic influence. But it will invariably be found that it has incurred this reproach by opposing and rebuking what was base in the national aspirations, not by thwarting what was heroic or just. As the Church perfects the nation, so reciprocally does each nation add something of its own to the glory of the Church. It brings its own type of sanctity, its national virtues, and thus contributes to "the fullness of Christ" something which no other race could give. Such are the relations of the Church to what is termed nationality. The external unity of the one society is the visible embodiment of the doctrine of the brotherhood of man. The sin of schism, the Fathers tell us, lies in this, that by it the law of love to our neighbour is implicitly rejected. "Nec hæretici pertinent ad Ecclesiam Catholicam, qæ diligit Deum; nec schismatici quoniam diligit proximum" (Neither do heretics belong to the Catholic church, for she loves God; nor do schismatics, for she loves her neighbour — Augustine, On Faith and the Creed 10). It is of importance to insist on this point. For it is sometimes urged that the organized unity of Catholicism may be adapted to the Latin races but is ill-suited to the Teutonic spirit. To say this is to say that an essential characteristic of this Christian revelation is ill-suited to one of the great races of the world.<br>The union of different nations in one society is contrary to the natural inclinations of fallen humanity. It must ever struggle against the impulses of national pride, the desire for complete independence, the dislike of external control. Hence history provides various cases in which these passions have obtained the upper hand, the bond of unity has been broken, and "National Churches" have been formed. In every such case the so-called National Church has found to its cost that, in severing its connection with the Holy See, it has lost its one protector against the encroachments of the secular Government. The Greek Church under the Byzantine Empire, the autocephalous Russian Church today, have been mere pawns in the hands of the civil authority. The history of the Anglican Church presents the same features. There is but one institution which is able to resist the pressure of secular powers — the See of Peter, which was set in the Church for this purpose by Christ, that it might afford a principle of stability and security to every part. The papacy is above all nationalities. It is the servant of no particular State; and hence it has strength to resist the forces that would make the religion of Christ subservient to secular ends. Those Churches alone have retained their vitality which have kept their union with the See of Peter. The branches which have been broken from that stem have withered.<br><br>In the course of the nineteenth century, the principle of National Churches was strenuously defended by the High Church Anglican divines under the name of the "Branch theory". According to this view, each National Church when fully constituted under its own episcopate is independent of external control. It possesses plenary authority as to its internal discipline, and may not merely reform itself as regards ritual and ceremonial usages, but may correct obvious abuses in matters of doctrine. It is justified in doing this even if the step involve a breach of communion with the rest of Christendom; for, in this case, the blame attaches not to the Church which undertakes the work of reformation, but to those which, on this score, reject it from communion. It still remains a "branch" of the Catholic Church as it was before. At the present day the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Greek Churches are each of them a branch of the Universal Church. None of them has an exclusive right to term itself the Catholic Church. The defenders of the theory recognize, indeed, that this divided state of the church is abnormal. They admit that the Fathers never contemplated the possibility of a church thus severed into parts. But they assert that circumstances such as those which led to this abnormal state of things never presented themselves during the early centuries of ecclesiastical history.<br>The position is open to fatal objections.<br>
<br>It is an entirely novel theory as to the constitution of the Church, which is rejected alike by the Catholic and the Greek Churches. Neither of these admit the existence of the so-called branches of the Church. The Greek schismatics, no less than the Catholics, affirm that they, and they only, constitute the Church. Further, the theory is rejected by the majority of the Anglican body. It is the tenet of but one school, though that a distinguished one. It Is almost a reductio ad absurdum when we are asked to believe that a single school in a particular sect is the sole depositary of the true theory of the Church.
<br>The claim made by many Anglicans that there is nothing in their position contrary to ecclesiastical and patristic tradition in quite indefensible. Arguments precisely applicable to their case were used by the Fathers against the Donatists. It is known from the "Apologia" that Cardinal Wiseman's masterly demonstration of this point was one of the chief factors in bringing about the conversion of Newman. In the controversy with the Donatists, St. Augustine holds it sufficient for his purpose to argue that those who are separated from the Universal Church cannot be in the right. He makes the question one of simple fact. Are the Donatists separated from the main body of Christians, or are they not? If they are, no vindication of their cause can absolve them from the charge of schism. "Securus judicat orbis terrarum bonos non esse qui se dividunt ab orbe terrarum in quâcunque parte orbis terrarum" (The entire world judges with security that they are not good, who separate themselves from the entire world in whatever part of the entire world — Augustine, contra epist. Parm., III, c. iv in P.L., XLIII, 101). St. Augustine's position rests through out on the doctrine he assumes as absolutely indubitable, that Christ's Church must be one, must be visibly one; and that any body that is separated from it is ipso facto shown to be in schism.<br>
The contention of the Anglican controversialists that the English Church is not separatist since it did not reject the communion of Rome, but Rome rejected it, has of course only the value of a piece of special pleading, and need not be taken as a serious argument. Yet it is interesting to observe that in this too they were anticipated by the Donatists (Against Petilian 2.38).
<br>The consequences of the doctrine constitute a manifest proof of its falsity. The unity of the Catholic Church in every part of the world is, as already seen, the sign of the brotherhood which binds together the children of God. More than this, Christ Himself declared that it would be a proof to all men of His Divine mission. The unity of His flock, an earthly representation of the unity of the Father and the Son, would be sufficient to show that He had come from God (John 17:21). Contrariwise, this theory, first advanced to justify a state of things having Henry VIII as its author, would make the Christian Church, not a witness to the brotherhood of God's children, but a standing proof that even the Son of God had failed to withstand the spirit of discord amongst men. Were the theory true, so far from the unity of the Church testifying to the Divine mission of <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>, its severed and broken condition would be a potent argument in the hands of unbelief.
<br><br>By the notes of the Church are meant certain conspicuous characteristics which distinguish it from all other bodies and prove it to be the one society of <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>. Some such distinguishing marks it needs must have, if it is, indeed, the sole depositary of the blessings of redemption, the way of salvation offered by God to man. A Babel of religious organizations all proclaim themselves to be the Church of Christ. Their doctrines are contradictory; and precisely in so far as any one of them regards the doctrines which it teaches as of vital moment, it declares those of the rival bodies to be misleading and pernicious. Unless the true Church were endowed with such characteristics as would prove to all men that it, and it alone, had a right to the name, how could the vast majority of mankind distinguish the revelation of God from the inventions of man? If it could not authenticate its claim, it would be impossible for it to warn all men that to reject it was to reject Christ. In discussing the visibility of the Church (VII) it was seen that the Catholic Church points to four such notes — those namely which were inserted in the Nicene Creed at the Council of Constantinople (A.D. 381): Unity, Sanctity, Catholicity, and Apostolicity. These, it declares, distinguish it from every other body, and prove that in it alone is to be found the true religion. Each of these characteristics forms the subject of a special article in this work. Here, however, will be indicated the sense in which the terms are to be understood. A brief explanation of their meaning will show how decisive a proof they furnish that the society of <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a> is none other than the Church in communion with the Holy See.<br>The Protestant reformers endeavoured to assign notes of the Church, such as might lend support to their newly-founded sects. Calvin declares that the Church is to be found "where the word of God is preached in its purity, and the sacraments administered according to Christ's ordinance" (Instit., Bk. IV, c. i; cf. Confessio August., art. 4). It is manifest that such notes are altogether nugatory. The very reason why notes are required at all is that men may be able to discern the word of God from the words of false prophets, and may know which religious body has a right to term its ceremonies the sacraments of Christ. To say that the Church is to be sought where these two qualities are found cannot help us. The Anglican Church adopted Calvin's account in its official formulary (Thirty-Nine Articles, art. 17); on the other hand, it retains the use of the Nicene Creed; though a profession of faith in a Church which is One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic, can have little meaning to those who are not in communion with the successor of Peter.<br><br>The Church is One because its members;<br>
<br>Are all united under one government
<br>All profess the same faith
<br>All join in a common worship
<br>As already noted (XI) Christ Himself declared that the unity of his followers should bear witness to Him. Discord and separation are the Devil's work on the earth. The unity and brotherhood promised by Christ are to be the visible manifestation on the earth of the Divine union (John 17:21). St. Paul's teaching on this point is to the same effect. He sees in the visible unity of the body of Christ an external sign of the oneness of the Spirit who dwells within it. There is, he says, "one body and one Spirit" (Ephesians 4:4). As in any living organism the union of the members in one body is the sign of the one animating principle within, so it is with the Church. If the Church were divided into two or more mutually exclusive bodies, how could she witness to the presence of that Spirit Whose name is Love. Further, when it is said that the members of the Church are united by the profession of the same faith, we speak of external profession as well as inward acceptance. In recent years, much has been said by those outside the Church, about unity of spirit being compatible with differences of creed. Such words are meaningless in reference to a Divine revelation. Christ came from heaven to reveal the truth to man. If a diversity of creeds could be found in His Church, this could only be because the truth He revealed had been lost in the quagmire of human error. It would signify that His work was frustrated, that His Church was no longer the pillar and ground of the truth. There is, it is plain, but one Church, in which is found the unity we have described — in the Catholic Church, united under the government of the supreme pontiff, and acknowledging all that he teaches in his capacity as the infallible guide of the Church.<br><br>When the Church points to sanctity as one of her notes, it is manifest that what is meant is a sanctity of such a kind as excludes the supposition of any natural origin. The holiness which marks the Church should correspond to the holiness of its Founder, of the Spirit Who dwells within it, of the graces bestowed upon it. A quality such as this may well serve to distinguish the true Church from counterfeits. It is not without reason that the Church of Rome claims to be holy in this sense. Her holiness appears in the doctrine which she teaches, in the worship she offers to God, in the fruits which she brings forth.<br>
<br>The doctrine of the Church is summed up in the imitation of <a data-href="Jesus Christ" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesus Christ</a>. This imitation expresses itself in good works, in self-sacrifice, in love of suffering, and especially in the practice of the three evangelical counsels of perfection — voluntary poverty, chastity, and obedience. The ideal which the Church proposes to us is a Divine ideal. The sects which have severed themselves from the Church have either neglected or repudiated some part of the Church's teaching in this regard. The Reformers of the sixteenth century went so far as to deny the value of good works altogether. Though their followers have for the most part let fall this anti-Christian doctrine, yet to this day the self-surrender of the religious state is regarded by Protestants as folly.
<br>The holiness of the Church's worship is recognized even by the world outside the Church. In the solemn renewal of the Sacrifice of Calvary there lies a mysterious power, which all are forced to own. Even enemies of the Church realize the sanctity of the Mass.
<br>Fruits of holiness are not, indeed, found in the lives of all the Church's children. Man's will is free, and though God gives grace, many who have been united to the Church by baptism make little use of the gift. But at all times of the Church's history there have been many who have risen to sublime heights of self-sacrifice, of love to man, and of love to God. It is only in the Catholic Church that is found that type of character which we recognize in the <a data-href="saint" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Saints/saint.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">saint</a>s — in men such as St. Francis Xavier, St. Vincent de Paul, and many others. Outside the Church men do not look for such holiness. Moreover, the <a data-href="saint" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Saints/saint.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">saint</a>s, and indeed every other member of the Church who has attained to any degree of piety, have been ever ready to acknowledge that they owe whatever is good in them to the grace the Church bestows.
<br><br>Christ founded the Church for the salvation of the human race. He established it that it might preserve His revelation, and dispense His grace to all nations. Hence it was necessary that it should be found in every land, proclaiming His message to all men, and communicating to them the means of grace. To this end He laid on the Apostles the Injunction to "go, and teach all nations". There is, notoriously, but one religious body which fulfills this command, and which can therefore lay any claim to the note of Catholicity. The Church which owns the Roman pontiff as its supreme head extends its ministrations over the whole world. It owns its obligation to preach the Gospel to all peoples. No other Church attempts this task, or can use the title of Catholic with any appearance of justification. The Greek Church is at the present day a mere local schism. None of the Protestant bodies has ever pretended to a universal mission. They claim no right to convert to their beliefs the Christianized nations of Europe. Even in regard to the heathen, for nearly two hundred years missionary enterprise was unknown among Protestant bodies. In the nineteenth century, it is true, many of them displayed no little zeal for the conversion of the heathen, and contributed large sums of money for this purpose. But the results achieved were so inadequate as to justify the conclusion that the blessing of God did not rest upon the enterprise. (See CATHOLIC MISSIONS; MISSIONS; PROTESTANT.)<br><br>The Apostolicity of the Church consists in its identity with the body which Christ established on the foundation of the Apostles, and which He commissioned to carry on His work. No other body save this is the Church of Christ. The true Church must be Apostolic in doctrine and Apostolic in mission. Since, however, it has already been shown that the gift of infallibility was promised to the Church, it follows that where there is Apostolicity of mission, there will also be Apostolicity of doctrine. Apostolicity of mission consists in the power of Holy orders and the power of jurisdiction derived by legitimate transmission from the Apostles. Any religious organization whose ministers do not possess these two powers is not accredited to preach the Gospel of Christ. For "how shall they preach", asks the Apostle, "unless they be sent?" (Romans 10:15). It is Apostolicity of mission which is reckoned as a note of the Church. No historical fact can be more clear than that Apostolicity, if it is found anywhere, is found in the Catholic Church. In it there is the power of Holy orders received by Apostolic succession. In it, too, there is Apostolicity of jurisdiction; for history shows us that the Roman bishop is the successor of Peter, and as such the centre of jurisdiction. Those prelates who are united to the Roman See receive their jurisdiction from the pope, who alone can bestow it. No other Church is Apostolic. The Greek church, it is true, claims to possess this property on the strength of its valid succession of bishops. But, by rejecting the authority of the Holy See, it severed itself from the Apostolic College, and thereby forfeited all jurisdiction. Anglicans make a similar claim. But even if they possessed valid orders, jurisdiction would be wanting to them no less than to the Greeks.<br><br>The Church has been considered as a society which aims at a spiritual end, but which yet is a visible polity, like the secular polities among which it exists. It is, further, a "perfect society". The meaning of this expression, "a perfect society", should be clearly understood, for this characteristic justifies, even on grounds of pure reason, that independence of secular control which the Church has always claimed. A society may be defined as a number of men who unite in a manner more or less permanent in order, by their combined efforts, to attain a common good. Association of this kind is a necessary condition of civilization. An isolated individual can achieve but little. He can scarcely provide himself with necessary sustenance; much less can he find the means of developing his higher mental and moral gifts. As civilization progresses, men enter into various societies for the attainment of various ends. These organizations are perfect or imperfect societies. For a society to be perfect, two conditions are necessary:<br>
<br>The end which it proposes to itself must not be purely subordinate to the end of some other society. For example, the cavalry of an army is an organized association of men; but the end for which this association exists is entirely subordinate to the good of the whole army. Apart from the success of the whole army, there can properly speaking be no such thing as the success of the lesser association. Similarly, the good of the whole army is subordinate to the welfare of the State.
<br>The society in question must be independent of other societies in regard to the attainment of its end. Mercantile societies, no matter how great their wealth and power, are imperfect; for they depend on the authority of the State for permission to exist. So, too, a single family is an imperfect society. It cannot attain its end — the well-being of its members — in isolation from other families. Civilized life requires that many families should cooperate to form a State.
<br>There are two societies which are perfect — the Church and the State. The end of the State is the temporal welfare of the community. It seeks to realize the conditions which are requisite in order that its members may be able to attain temporal felicity. It protects the rights, and furthers the interests of the individuals and the groups of individuals which belong to it. All other societies which aim in any manner at temporal good are necessarily imperfect. Either they exist ultimately for the good of the State itself; or, if their aim is the private advantage of some of its members, the State must grant them authorization, and protect them in the exercise of their various functions. Should they prove dangerous to it, it justly dissolves them. The Church also possesses the conditions requisite for a perfect society. That its end is not subordinate to that of any other society is manifest: for it aims at the spiritual welfare, the eternal felicity, of man. This is the highest end a society can have; it is certainly not an end subordinate to the temporal felicity aimed at by the State. Moreover, the Church is not dependent on the permission of the State in the attaining of its end. Its right to exist is derived not from the permission of the State, but from the command of God. Its right to preach the Gospel, to administer the sacraments, to exercise jurisdiction over its subjects, is not conditional on the authorization of the civil Government. It has received from Christ Himself the great commission to teach all nations. To the command of the civil Government that they should desist from preaching, the Apostles replied simply that they ought to obey God rather than men (Acts 5:29). Some measure of temporal goods is, indeed, necessary to the Church to enable it to carry out the work entrusted to it. The State cannot justly prohibit it from receiving this from the benefactions of the faithful. Those whose duty it is to achieve a certain end have a right to possess the means necessary to accomplish their task.<br>Pope Leo XIII summed up this doctrine in his Encyclical "Immortale Dei" (1 November, 1885) on the Christian constitution of States: "The Church", he says, "is distinguished and differs from civil society; and, what is of highest moment, it is a society chartered as of right divine, perfect in its nature and its title to possess in itself and by itself through the will and loving kindness of its Founder, all needful provision for its maintenance and action. And just as the end at which the Church aims is by far the noblest of ends, so is its authority the most excellent of all authority, nor can it be looked on as inferior to the civil power, or in any manner dependent upon it." It is to be observed that though the end at which the Church aims is higher than that of the State, the latter is not, as a society, subordinate to the Church. The two societies belong to different orders. The temporal felicity at which the State aims is not essentially dependent on the spiritual good which the Church seeks. Material prosperity and a high degree of civilization may be found where the Church does not exist. Each society is Supreme in its own order. At the same time each contributes greatly to the advantage of the other. The church cannot appeal to men who have not some rudiments of civilization, and whose savage mode of life renders moral development impossible. Hence, though her function is not to civilize but to save souls, yet when she is called on to deal with savage races, she commences by seeking to communicate the elements of civilization to them. On the other hand, the State needs the Supernatural sanctions and spiritual motives which the Church impresses on its members. A civil order without these is insecurely based.<br>It has often been objected that the doctrine of the Church's independence in regard to the State would render civil government impossible. Such a theory, it is urged, creates a State within a State; and from this, there must inevitably result a conflict of authorities each claiming supreme dominion over the same subjects. Such was the argument of the Gallican Regalists. The writers of this school, consequently, would not admit the claim of the Church to be a perfect society. They maintained that any jurisdiction which it might exercise was entirely dependent on the permission of the civil power. The difficulty, however, is rather apparent than real. The scope of the two authorities is different, the one belonging to what is temporal, the other to what is spiritual. Even when the jurisdiction of the Church involves the use of temporal means and affects temporal interests, it does not detract from the due authority of the State. If difficulties arise, they arise, not by the necessity of the case, but from some extrinsic reason. In the course of history, occasions have doubtless arisen, when ecclesiastical authorities have grasped at power which by right belonged to the State, and, more often still, when the State has endeavoured to arrogate to itself spiritual jurisdiction. This, however, does not show the system to be at fault, but merely that human perversity can abuse it. So far, indeed, is it from being true that the Church's claims render government impossible, that the contrary is the case. By determining the just limits of liberty of conscience, they are a defence to the State. Where the authority of the Church is not recognized, any enthusiast may elevate the vagaries of his own caprice into a Divine command, and may claim to reject the authority of the civil ruler on the plea that he must obey God and not man. The history of John of Leyden and of many another self-styled prophet will afford examples in point. The Church bids her members see in the civil power "the minister of God", and never justifies disobedience, except in those rare cases when the State openly violates the natural or the revealed law. (See CIVIL ALLEGIANCE.)<br><br>Among the writings of the Fathers, the following are the principal works which bear on the doctrine of the Church: ST. IRENÆUS, Adv.

 <br><br>A. Historically the oldest of pagan religions, the most fully developed, and the most deeply marked by vicissitude is that of India. Four divisions, distinct in history and nature, are recognizable: Vedism, Brahminism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Even in the ancient Vedic hymns a special priesthood is distinguishable, for although originally the father of the family was also the offerer of sacrifice, he usually sought the co-operation of a Brahmin. From the essential functions of praying and singing during the sacrifice arose in Vedism the three classes of sacrificing (adhvariu), singing (udgâtar), and praying priests (hotar). The four categories of soldier, priest, artisan or farmer, and slave developed formally in later Brahminism into the four rigidly distinguished castes (Dahlmann), the Brahmins meanwhile forging ahead of the soldiers to the position of chief importance. The Brahmins alone understood the intricate and difficult sacrificial ceremonial; thanks to their great knowledge and sacrifices, they exercised an irresistible influence over the gods; a pantheistic explanation of the god Brahma invested them with a divine character. The Brahmin was thus a sacred and inviolable person, and to murder him the greatest sin. Brahminism has wrongly been compared with medieval Christianity (cf. Teichmüller, "Religionsphilosophie", Leipzig, 1886, p. 528). In the Middle Ages there was indeed a privileged priesthood, but not an hereditary priestly caste; then as now the lowest classes could attain to the highest ecclesiastical offices. Still less justified, in view of the pantheistic character of the Brahminic religion, are all attempts to trace a genetic connection between the Catholic and Indian priesthoods, since the monotheistic spirit of Catholicism and the characteristic organization of its clergy are irreconcilable with a pantheistic conception of the Deity and the unsocial temper of a caste system.<br>The same remarks apply with even greater force to Buddhism which, through the reform introduced by King Asoka (239-23 B.C.), forced Brahminism into the background. As this reform inaugurated the reign of Agnosticism, Illusionism, and a one-sided morality, the Brahminic priesthood, with the decay of the ancient sacrificial services, lost its raison d'être. If there be no eternal substance, no Ego, no immortal soul, no life beyond, the idea of a God, of a Redeemer, of a priesthood forthwith disappears. The Buddhist redemption is merely an ascetical self-redemption wrought by sinking into the abyss of nothingness (Nirvana). The bonzes are not priests in the strict sense; nor has Buddhist monasticism anything beyond the name in common with Christian monasticism. Modern zealots for Buddhism declare with increasing boldness since Schopenhauer, that what they chiefly desire is a religion without dogma and without an alien redeemer, a service without a priesthood. It will therefore perhaps appear all the more extraordinary that Buddhism, in consequence of the efforts of the reformer Thong-Kaba, has developed in Tibet a formal hierarchy and hierocracy in Lamaism (Lama=Brahma).<br>The monasticism and the religious services of Lamaism also present so striking a similarity with Catholic institutions that non-Catholic investigators have unhesitatingly spoken of a "Buddhist Catholicism" in Tibet. Pope and dalai-lama, Rome and the city of Lhasa are counterparts; Lamaism has its monasteries, bells, processions, litanies, relics, images of saints, holy water, rosary-beads, bishop's mitre, crosier, vestments, copes, baptism, confession, mass, sacrifice for the dead. Nevertheless, since it is the interior spirit that gives a religion its characteristic stamp, we can recognize in these externals, not a true copy of Catholicism, but only a wretched caricature. And, since this religious compound undoubtedly came into existence only in the fourteenth century, it is evident that the remarkable parallelism is the result of Catholic influence on Lamaism, not vice versa. We can only suppose that the founder Thong-Kaba was educated by a Catholic missionary. Of modern Hinduism, Schanz draws a gloomy picture: "In addition to Vishnu and Siva, spirits and demons are worshipped and feared. The River Ganges is held in special veneration. The temples are often built near lakes because to all who bathe there Brahma promises forgiveness of sin. Beasts (cows), especially snakes, trees, and lifeless objects, serve as fetishes. Their offerings consist of flowers, oil, incense, and food. To Siva and his spouse bloody sacrifices are also offered. Nor are idolatry and prostitution wanting" ("Apologie d. Christentums", Freiburg, 1905, II, 84 sq.).<br>B. In the kindred but ethically superior religion of the Iranians (Parseeism, Zoroastrianism, Mazdeism), which unfortunately never overcame the theological dualism between the good god (Ormuzd=Athura-Mazda) and the wicked anti-god (Ahriman=Angrô-Mainyu), there existed from the beginning a special priestly caste, which in the Avesta was divided into six classes. The general name for priest was âthravan (man of fire), and the chief duty of the priesthood was the fire-service, fire being the special symbol of Ormuzd, the god of light. After the destruction of the Persian monarchy only two categories of priests remained: the officiating (zoatar, jôtî) and the ministering (rathwi). Both were later succeeded by the Median magicians (magus), called in modern Parseeism mobed (from mogh-pati, magic-father). In addition to the maintenance of the sacred fire, the duties of the priests were the offering of sacrifices (flesh, bread, flowers, fruit), the performance of purifications, prayers, and hymns, and instructing in the holy law. Sacrificial animals were placed on a bundle of twigs in the open air, lest the pure earth should be defiled with blood. The human sacrifices, customary from time immemorial, were abolished by Zoroaster (Zarathustra). In ancient times the fire-altars were placed in the open air, and preferably on the mountains, but the modern Parsees have special fire-temples. The haoma, as the oldest sacrifice, calls for particular mention; manufactured out of the narcotic juice of a certain plant and used as a drink-offering, it was identified with the Deity Himself and given to the faithful as a means of procuring immortality. This Iranian haoma is doubtlessly identical with the Indian soma, the intoxicating juice of which (asclepias acida or sacrostemma acidum) was supposed to restore to man the immortality lost in Paradise (see EUCHARIST). When, during the reign of the Sassanides, Mithras the sun-god — according to the later Avesta, high-priest and mediator between god and man — had gradually supplanted the creative god Ormuzd, Persian Mithra-worship held the field almost unopposed; and under the Roman Empire it exerted an irresistible influence on the West (see MASS).<br>C. To turn to classical antiquity, Greece never possessed an exclusive priestly caste, although from the Dorian-Ionian period the public priesthood was regarded as the privilege of the nobility. In Homer the kings also offer sacrifices to the gods. Public worship was in general undertaken by the State, and the priests were state officials, assigned as a rule to the service of special temples. The importance of the priesthood grew with the extension of the mysteries, which were embodied especially in the Orphic and Eleusinian cults. Sacrifices were always accompanied with prayers, for which as the expression of their religious sentiments the Greeks showed a special preference.<br>But among no people in the world were religion, sacrifice, and the priesthood to such an extent the business of the State as among the ancient Romans. At the dawn of their history, their legendary kings (e.g. Numa) are themselves the sacrificial priests. Under the Republic, the priestly office was open only to the patricians until the Lex Ogulina (about 300 B.C.) admitted also the plebeians. As the special object of Roman sacrifice was to avert misfortune and win the favour of the gods, divination played in it from the earliest times an important role. Hence the importance of the various classes of priests, who interpreted the will of the gods from the flight of birds or the entrails of the beasts of sacrifice (augures, haruspices). There were many other categories: pontifices, flamines, fetiales, luperci, etc. During imperial times the emperor was the high-priest (pontifex maximus).<br>D. According to Tacitus, the religion of the ancient Germans was a simple worship of the gods, without images; their services took place, not in temples, but in sacred groves. The priests, if one may call them such, were highly respected, and possessed judicial powers, as the Old High German word for priest, êwarte (guardians of justice), shows. But a far greater influence among the people was exercised by the Celtic priests or druids (Old Irish, drui, magician). Their real home was Ireland and Britain, whence they were transplanted to Gaul in the third century before Christ. Here they appear as a priestly caste, exempt from taxes and military service; they constitute with the nobility the ruling class, and by their activity as teachers, judges, and physicians become the representatives of a higher religious, moral, and intellectual culture. The druids taught the existence of Divine providence, the immortality of the soul, and transmigration. They appear to have had images of the gods and to have offered human sacrifices — the latter practice may have come down from a much earlier period. Their religious services were usually held on heights and in oak-groves. After the conquest of Gaul the druids declined in popular esteem.<br>E. The oldest religion of the Chinese is Sinism, which may be characterized as "the most perfect, spiritualistic, and moral Monotheism known to antiquity outside of Judea" (Schanz). It possessed no distinct priesthood, the sacrifices (animals, fruits, and incense) being offered by state officials in the name of the ruler. In this respect no alteration was made by the reformer Confucius (sixth century B.C.), although he debased the concept of religion and made the almost deified emperor "the Son of Heaven" and the organ of the cosmic intellect. In direct contrast to this priestless system Laotse (b. 604 B.C.), the founder of Taoism (tao, reason), introduced both monasticism and a regular priesthood with a high-priest at its head. From the first century before Christ, these two religions found a strong rival in Buddhism, although Confucianism remains even today the official religion of China.<br>The original national religion of the Japanese was Shintoism, a strange compound of nature-, ancestor-, and hero-worship. It is a religion without dogmas, without a moral code, without sacred writings. The Mikado is a son of the Deity, and as such also high-priest; his palace is the temple — it was only in much later times that the Temple of Ise was built. About A.D. 280 Confucianism made its way into Japan from China, and tried to coalesce with the kindred Shintoism. The greatest blow to Shintoism, however, was struck by Buddhism, which entered Japan in A.D. 552, and, by an extraordinary process of amalgamation, united with the old national religion to form a third. This fusion is known as Rio-bu-Shinto. In the Revolution of 1868, this composite religion was set aside, and pure Shintoism declared the religion of the State. In 1877 the law establishing this situation was repealed, and in 1889 general religious freedom was granted. The various orders of rank among priests had been abolished in 1879.<br>F. With the ancient religion of the Egyptians the idea of the priesthood was inseparably bound up for many thousand years. Though the ruler for the time being was nominally the only priest, there had developed even in the ancient kingdom (from about 3400 B.C.) a special priestly caste, which in the middle kingdom (from about 2000 B.C.), and still more in the late kingdom (from about 1090 B.C.), became the ruling class. The great attempt at reform by King Amenhotep IV (died 1374 B.C.), who tried to banish all gods except the sun-god from the Egyptian religion and to make sun-worship the religion of the State, was thwarted by the opposition of the priests. The whole twenty-first dynasty was a family of priest-kings. Although Moses, learned as he was in the wisdom of the Egyptians, may have been indebted to an Egyptian model for one or two external features in his organization of Divine worship, he was, thanks to the Divine inspiration, entirely original in the establishment of the Jewish priesthood, which is based on the unique idea of Jahweh's covenant with the Chosen People (cf. "Realencyklopädie für protest. Theologie", XVI, Leipzig, 1905, 33). Still less warranted is the attempt of some writers on the comparative history of religions to trace the origin of the Catholic priesthood to the Egyptian priestly castes. For at the very time when this borrowing might have taken place, Egyptian idolatry had degenerated into such loathsome animal-worship, that not only the Christians, but the pagans themselves turned away from it in disgust (cf. Aristides, "Apol.", xii; Clement of Alexandria, "Cohortatio", ii).<br>G. In the religion of the Semites, we meet first the Babylonian-Assyrian priests, who, under the name "Chaldeans", practiced the interpretation of dreams and the reading of the stars and conducted special schools for priests, besides performing their functions in connection with the sacrifices. Hence their division into various classes: sacrificers (nisakku), seers (bârû), exorcist (asipu) etc. Glorious temples with idols of human and hybrid form arose in Assyria, and (apart from the obligatory cult of the stars) served for astrological and astronomical purposes. Among the Syrians the cruel, voluptuous cult of Moloch and Astarte found its special home, Astarte especially (Babylonian, Ishtar) being known to the ancients simply as the "Syrian Goddess" (Dea Syria). Likewise among the semitized Phoenicians, Ammonites, and Philistines these ominous deities found special veneration. Howling and dancing priests sought to appease the bloodthirsty Moloch by sacrifices of children and self-mutilation, as the analogous Galh strove to pacify the Phrygian goddess Cybele. The notorious priests of Baal of the Chanaanites were for the Jews as strong an incentive to idolatry as the cult of Astarte was a temptation to immorality. The south-Semitic religion of the ancient pagan Arabians was a plain religion of the desert without a distinct priesthood: modern Islam or Mohammedanism has a clergy (muezzin, announcer of the hours of prayer; imâm, leader of the prayers; khâtib, preacher), but no real priesthood. The west-Semitic branch of the Hebrews is treated in the next section.<br><br>In the age of the Patriarchs the offering of sacrifices was the function of the father or head of the family (cf. Genesis 8:20; 12:7, etc.; Job 1:5). But, even before Moses, there were also regular priests, who were not fathers of family (cf. Exodus 19:22 sqq.). Hummelauer's hypothesis "Das vormosaische Priestertum in Israel", Freiburg, 1899) that this pre-Mosaic priesthood was established by God Himself and made hereditary in the family of Manasses, but was subsequently abolished in punishment of the worship of the golden calf (cf. Exodus 32:26 sqq.), can hardly be scientifically established (cf. Rev. bibl. internat., 1899, pp. 470 sqq.). In the Mosaic priesthood we must distinguish: priests, Levites, and high-priest.<br><br>It was only after the Sinaitical legislation that the Israelitic priesthood became a special class in the community. From the tribe of Levi Jahweh chose the house of Aaron to discharge permanently and exclusively all the religious functions; Aaron himself and later the first-born of his family was to stand at the head of this priesthood as high-priest, while the other Levites were to act, not as priests, but as assistants and servants. The solemn consecration of the Aaronites to the priesthood took place at the same time as the anointing of Aaron as high-priest and with almost the same ceremonial (Exodus 29:1-37; 40:12 sqq.; Leviticus 8:1-36). This single consecration included that of all the future descendants of the priests, so that the priesthood was fixed in the house of Aaron by mere descent, and was thus hereditary. After the Babylonian Exile strict genealogical proof of priestly descent was even more rigidly demanded, and any failure to furnish the same meant exclusion from the priesthood (Ezra 2:61 sq.; Nehemiah 7:63 sq.). Certain bodily defects, of which the later Talmudists mention 142, were also a disqualification from the exercise of the priestly office (Leviticus 21:17 sqq.). Age limits (twenty and fifty years) were also appointed (2 Chronicles 31:17); the priests were forbidden to take to wife a harlot or a divorced woman (Leviticus 21:7); during the active discharge of the priesthood, marital intercourse was forbidden. In addition to an unblemished earlier life, levitical cleanness was also indispensable for the priesthood. Whoever performed a priestly function in levitical uncleanness was to be expelled like one who entered the sanctuary after partaking of wine or other intoxicating drinks (Leviticus 10:9; 22:3). To incur an uncleanness "at the death of his citizens", except in the case of immediate kin, was rigidly forbidden (Leviticus 21:1 sqq.). In cases of mourning no outward signs of sorrow might be shown (e.g. by rending the garments). On entering into their office, the priests had first to take a bath of purification (Exodus 29:4; 40:12), be sprinkled with oil (Exodus 29:21; Leviticus 8:30), and put on the vestments.<br>The priestly vestments consisted of breeches, tunic, girdle, and mitre. The breeches (feminalia linea) covered from the reins to the thighs (Exodus 28:42). The tunic (tunica) was a kind of coat, woven in a special manner from one piece; it had narrow sleeves, extended from the throat to the ankles, and was brought together at the throat with bands (Exodus 28:4). The girdle (balteus) was three or four fingers in breadth and (according to rabbinic tradition) thirty-two ells long; it had to be embroidered after the same pattern and to be of the same colour as the curtain of the forecourt and the tabernacle of the covenant (Exodus 39:38). The official vestments were completed by the mitre (Exodus 39:26), a species of cap of fine linen. As nothing is said of foot-covering, the priests must have performed the services barefooted as Jewish tradition indeed declares (cf. Exodus 3:5). These vestments were prescribed for use only during the services; at other times they were kept in an appointed place in charge of a special custodian. For detailed information concerning the priestly vestments, see Josephus, "Antiq.", III, vii, 1 sqq.<br>The official duties of the priests related partly to their main occupations, and partly to subsidiary services. To the former category belonged all functions connected with the public worship, e.g. the offering of incense twice daily (Exodus 30:7), the weekly renewal of the loaves of proposition on the golden table (Leviticus 24:9), the cleaning and filling of the oil-lamps on the golden candlestick (lev., xxiv, 1). All these services were performed in the sanctuary. There were in addition certain functions to be performed in the outer court — the maintenance of the sacred fire on the altar for burnt sacrifices (Leviticus 6:9 sqq.), the daily offering of the morning and evening sacrifices, especially of the lambs (Exodus 29:38 sqq.). As subsidiary services the priests had to present the cursed water to wives suspected of adultery (Numbers 5:12 sqq.), sound the trumpets announcing the holy-days (Numbers 10:1 sqq.), declare the lepers clean or unclean (Leviticus 13-14; Deuteronomy 24:8; cf. Matthew 8:4), dispense from vows, appraise all objects vowed to the sanctuary (Leviticus 27), and finally offer sacrifice for those who broke the law of the Nazarites, i.e. a vow to avoid all intoxicating drinks and every uncleanness (especially from contact with a corpse) and to let one's hair grow long (Numbers 6:1-21). The priests furthermore were teachers and judges; not only were they to explain the law to the people (Leviticus 10:11; Deuteronomy 33:10) without remuneration (Micah 3:11) and to preserve carefully the Book of the Law, of which a copy was to be presented to the (future) king (Deuteronomy 17:18), but they had also to settle difficult lawsuits among the people (Deuteronomy 17:8; 19:17; 21:5). In view of the complex nature of the liturgical service, David later divided the priesthood into twenty-four classes or courses, of which each in turn, with its eldest member at its head, had to perform the service from one Sabbath to the next (2 Kings 11:9; cf. Luke 1:8). The order of the classes was determined by lot (1 Chronicles 24:7 sqq.).<br>The income of the priests was derived from the tithes and the firstlings of fruits and animals. To these were added as accidentals the remains of the food, and guilt-oblations, which were not entirely consumed by fire; also the hides of the animals sacrificed and the natural products and money vowed to God (Leviticus 27; Numbers 8:14). With all these perquisites, the Jewish priests seem never to have been a wealthy class, owing partly to the increase in their numbers and partly to the large families which they reared. But their exalted office, their superior education, and their social position secured them great prestige among the people. In general, they fulfilled their high position worthily, even though they frequently merited the stern reproof of the Prophets (cf. Jeremiah 5:31; Ezekiel 22:26; Hosea 6:9; Micah 3:11; Malachi 1:7). With the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in A.D. 70 the entire sacrificial service and with it the Jewish priesthood ceased. The later rabbis never represent themselves as priests, but merely as teachers of the law.<br><br>It has been said above that the real priesthood was hereditary in the house of Aaron alone, and that to the other descendants of Levi was assigned a subordinate position as servants and assistants of the priests. The latter are the Levites in the narrow sense. They were divided into the families of the Gersonites, Caathites, and Merarites (Exodus 6:16; Numbers 26:57), so named after Levi's three sons, Gerson, Caath, and Merari (cf. Genesis 46:11; 1 Chronicles 6:1). As simple servants of the priests, the Levites might not enter the sanctuary, nor perform the real sacrificial act, especially the sprinkling of the blood (aspersio sanguinis). This was the privilege of the priests (Numbers 18:3, 19 sqq.; 18:6). The Levites had however to assist the latter during the sacred services, prepare the different oblations and keep the sacred vessels in proper condition. Among their chief duties was the constant guarding of the tabernacle with the ark of the covenant; the Gersonites were encamped towards the west, the Caathites towards the south, the Merarites towards the north, while Moses and Aaron with their sons guarded the holy tabernacle towards the east (Numbers 3:23 sqq.). When the tabernacle had found a fixed home in Jerusalem, David created four classes of Levites: servants of the priests, officials and judges, porters, and finally musicians and singers (1 Chronicles 23:3 sqq.). After the building of the Temple by Solomon the Levites naturally became its guardians (1 Chronicles 26:12 sqq.). When the Temple was rebuilt Levites were established as guards in twenty-one places around (Talmud; Middoth, I, i). In common with the priests, the Levites were also bound to instruct the people in the Law (2 Chronicles 17:8; Nehemiah 8:7), and they even possessed at times certain judicial powers (2 Chronicles 19:11).<br>They were initiated into office by a rite of consecration: sprinkling with the water of purification, shaving of the hair, washing of the garments, offering of sacrifices, imposition of the hands of the eldest (Numbers 8:5 sqq.). As to the age of service, thirty years was fixed for the time of entrance and fifty for retirement from office (Numbers 4:3; 1 Chronicles 23:24; Ezra 3:8). No special vestments were prescribed for them in the Law; in the time of David and Solomon the bearers of the ark of the covenant and the singers wore garments of fine linen (1 Chronicles 15:27; 2 Chronicles 5:12). At the division of the Promised Land among the Twelve Tribes, the tribe of Levi was left without territory, since the Lord Himself was to be their portion and inheritance (cf. Numbers 18:20; Deuteronomy 12:12; Joshua 13:14). In compensation, Jahweh ceded to the Levites and priests the gifts of natural products made by the people, and other revenues. The Levites first received the tithes of fruits and beasts of the field (Leviticus 27:30 sqq.; Numbers 18:20 sq.), of which they had in turn to deliver the tenth part to the priests (Numbers 18:26 sqq.). In addition, they had a share in the sacrificial banquets (Deuteronomy 12:18) and were, like the priests, exempt from taxes and military service. The question of residence was settled by ordering the tribes endowed with landed property to cede to the Levites forty-eight Levite towns, scattered over the land, with their precincts (Numbers 35:1 sqq.); of these, thirteen were assigned to the priests. After the division of the monarchy into the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the Southern Kingdom of Juda, many Levites from the northern portion removed to the Kingdom of Juda, which remained true to the Law, and took up their abode in Jerusalem. After the Northern Kingdom had been chastised by the Assyrian deportation in 722 B.C., the Southern Kingdom was also overthrown by the Babylonians in 606 B.C., and numbers of the Jews, including many Levites, were hurried away into the "Babylonian exile". Only a few Levites returned to their old home under Esdras in 450 (cf. Ezra 2:40 sqq.). With the destruction of the Herodian Temple in A.D. 70 the doom of the Levites was sealed.<br><br>At Jahweh's command Moses consecrated his brother Aaron first high-priest, repeated the consecration on seven days, and on the eighth day solemnly introduced him into the tabernacle of the covenant. The consecration of Aaron consisted in washings, investment with costly vestments, anointing with holy oil, and the offerings of various sacrifices (Exodus 29). As a sign that Aaron was endowed with the fullness of the priesthood, Moses poured over his head the oil of anointing (Leviticus 8:12), while the other Aaronites, as simple priests, had only their hands anointed (Exodus 29:7, 29). The high-priest was for the Jews the highest embodiment of theocracy, the monarch of the whole priesthood, the special mediator between God and the People of the Covenant, and the spiritual head of the synagogue. He was the priest par excellence, the "great priest" (Greek, archiereus), the "prince among the priests", and, because of the anointing of his head, the "anointed priest". To this exalted office corresponded his special and costly vestments, worn in addition to those of the simple priests (Exodus 28). A (probably sleeveless) purple-blue upper garment (tunica) fell to his knees, the lower seam being ornamented alternately with small golden bells and pomegranates of coloured thread. About the shoulders he also wore a garment called the ephod; this was made of costly material, and consisted of two portions about an ell long, which covered the back and breast, were held together above by two shoulderbands or epaulets, and terminated below with a magnificent girdle. Attached to the ephod in front was the shield (rationale), a square bag bearing on the outside the names of the twelve tribes engraved on precious stones (Exodus 28:6), and containing within the celebrated Urim and Thummim as the means of obtaining Divine oracles and prophecies. The vestments of the high-priest were completed by a precious turban (tiara), bearing on a golden frontal plate the inscription: "Sacred to Jahweh".<br>The high-priest had supreme supervision of the Ark of the Covenant (and of the Temple), of Divine service in general and of the whole personnel connected with public worship. He presided at the Sanhedrin. He alone could perform the liturgy on the Feast of Expiation, on which occasion he put on his costly vestments only after the sacrifices were completed. He alone might offer sacrifice for his own sins and those of the people (Leviticus 4:5), enter the holy of holies (sanctum sanctorum), and seek counsel of Jahweh on important occasions. The office of high-priest in the house of Aaron was at first hereditary in the line of his first-born son Eleazar, but in the period from Heli to Abiathar (1131 to 973 B.C.) it belonged, by right of primogeniture, to the line of Ithamar. Under the rule of the Seleucidæ (from about 175 B.C.) the office was sold for money to the highest bidder. At a later period it became hereditary in the family of the Hasmon. With the destruction of the central sanctuary by the Romans, the high-priesthood disappeared.<br>Against the foregoing account of the Mosaic priesthood, based on the Old Testament, the negative biblical critics of today make a determined stand. According to the hypothesis of Graf-Wellhausen, Moses (about 1250 B.C.) cannot be the author of the Pentateuch. He was not the Divinely appointed legislator, but simply the founder of Monolatry, for ethical Monotheism resulted from the efforts of much later Prophets. Deuteronomy D made its appearance in substance in 621 B.C., when the astute high-priest Helkias by a pious fraud palmed off on the god-fearing King Josias the recently composed "Book of the Laws" D as written by Moses (cf. 2 Kings 22:1 sqq.) When Esdras returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian Exile about 450 B.C., he brought back the "Book of the Ritual" or the priest's codex P, i.e., the middle portions between Genesis and Deuteronomy, composed by himself and his school in Babylon, although it was only in 444 B.C. that he dared to make it public. A clever editor now introduced the portions relating to public worship into the old, pre-Exilic historical books, and the entirely new idea of an Aaronic priesthood and of the centralization of the cult was projected back to the time of Moses. The story of the tabernacle of the covenant is thus a mere fiction, devised to represent the Temple at Jerusalem as established in fully developed form at the dawn of Israelitic history and to justify the unity of worship. Although this hypothesis does not contest the great antiquity of the Jewish priesthood, it maintains that the centralization of the cult, the essential difference between priests and Levites, the supreme authority of the priests of the Temple at Jerusalem as compared with the so-called hill-priests (cf. Ezekiel 44:4 sqq.), must be referred to post-Exilic times.<br>Without entering upon a detailed criticism of these assertions of Wellhausen and the critical school (see PENTATEUCH), we may here remark in general that the conservative school also admits or can admit that only the original portion of the Pentateuch is to be accepted as Mosaic, that in the same text many repetitions seem to have been brought together from different sources, and finally that additions, extensions, and adaptations to new conditions by an inspired author of a later period are by no means excluded. It must also be admitted that, though one place of worship was appointed, sacrifices were offered even in early times by laymen and simple Levites away from the vicinity of the Ark of the Covenant, and that in restless and politically disturbed epochs the ordinance of Moses could not always be observed. In the gloomy periods marked by neglect of the Law, no attention was paid to the prohibition of hill-sacrifices, and the Prophets were often gratified to find that on the high places (bamoth) sacrifice was offered, not to pagan gods, but to Jahweh. However, the Pentateuch problem is one of the most difficult and intricate questions in Biblical criticism. The Wellhausen hypothesis with its bold assumptions of pious deceits and artificial projections is open to as great, if not greater, difficulties and mysteries as the traditional view, even though some of its contributions to literary criticism may stand examination. It cannot be denied that the critical structure has suffered a severe shock since the discovery of the Tell-el-Amarna letters dating from the fifteenth century B.C., and since the deciphering of the Hammurabi Code. The assumption that the oldest religion of Israel must have been identical with that of the primitive Semites (Polydæmonism, Animism, Fetishism, Ancestor-worship) has been proved false, since long before 2000 B.C. a kind of Henotheism, i.e., Polytheism with a monarchical head was the ruling religion in Babylon. The beginnings of the religions of all peoples are purer and more spiritual than many historians of religions have hitherto been willing to admit. One thing is certain: the final word has not yet been spoken as to the value of the Wellhausen hypothesis.<br><br>In the New Testament bishops and priests are, according to Catholic teaching, the sole bearers of the priesthood, the former enjoying the fullness of the priesthood (summus sacerdos s. primi ordinis), while the presbyters are simple priests (simplex sacerdos s. secundi ordinis). The deacon, on the other hand, is a mere attendant of the priest, with no priestly powers. Omitting all special treatment of the bishop and the deacon, we here confine our attention primarily to the presbyterate, since the term "priest" without qualification is now taken to signify the presbyter.<br><br>According to the Protestant view, there was in the primitive Christian Church no essential distinction between laity and clergy, no hierarchical differentiation of the orders (bishop, priest, deacon), no recognition of pope and bishops as the possessors of the highest power of jurisdiction over the Universal Church or over its several territorial divisions. On the contrary, the Church had at first a democratic constitution, in virtue of which the local churches selected their own heads and ministers, and imparted to these their inherent spiritual authority, just as in the modern republic the "sovereign people" confers upon its elected president and his officials administrative authority. The deeper foundation for this transmission of power is to be sought in the primitive Christian idea of the universal priesthood, which excludes the recognition of a special priesthood. Christ is the sole high-priest of the New Testament, just as His bloody death on the Cross is the sole sacrifice of Christianity. If all Christians without exception are priests in virtue of their baptism, an official priesthood obtained by special ordination is just as inadmissible as the Catholic Sacrifice of the Mass. Not the material sacrifice of the Eucharist, consisting in the offering of (real) gifts, but only the purely spiritual sacrifice of prayer harmonizes with the spirit of Christianity. One is indeed forced to admit that the gradual corruption of Christianity began very early (end of first century), since it cannot be denied that Clement of Rome (Ep. ad Cor., xliv, 4), the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (Didache, xiv), and Tertullian (On Baptism 17; "De præsc. hær.", xli; "De exhort. cast.", vii) recognize an official priesthood with the objective Sacrifice of the Mass. The corruption quickly spread throughout the whole East and West, and persisted unchecked during the Middle Ages, until the Reformation finally succeeded in restoring to Christianity its original purity. Then "the idea of the universal priesthood was revived; it appeared as the necessary consequence of the very nature of Christianity. . . . Since the whole idea of sacrifice was discarded, all danger of reversion to the beliefs once derived from it was removed" ("Realency cl. für prot. Theol.", XVI, Leipzig, 1905, p. 50).<br>To these views we may answer briefly as follows. Catholic theologians do not deny that the double "hierarchy of order and jurisdiction" gradually developed from the germ already existing in the primitive Church, just as the primacy of the pope of Rome and especially the distinction of simple priests from the bishops was recognized with increasing clearness as time advanced (see HIERARCHY). But the question whether there was at the beginning a special priesthood in the Church is altogether distinct. If it is true that "the reception of the idea of sacrifice led to the idea of the ecclesiastical priesthood" (loc. cit., p. 48), and that priesthood and sacrifice are reciprocal terms, then the proof of the Divine origin of the Catholic priesthood must be regarded as established, once it is shown that the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Mass is coeval with the beginnings and the essence of Christianity. In proof of this we may appeal even to the Old Testament. When the Prophet Isaias foresees the entrance of pagans into the Messianic Kingdom, he makes the calling of priests from the heathen (i.e. the non-Jews) a special characteristic of the new Church (Isaiah 66:21): "And I will take of them to be priests and Levites, saith the Lord". Now this non-Jewish (Christian) priesthood in the future Messianic Church presupposes a permanent sacrifice, namely that "clean oblation", which from the rising of the sun even to the going down is to be offered to the Lord of hosts among the Gentiles (Malachi 1:11). The sacrifice of bread and wine offered by Melchisedech (cf. Genesis 14:18 sqq.), the prototype of Christ (cf. Psalm 109:4; Hebrews 5:5 sq.; 7:1 sqq.), also refers prophetically, not only to the Last Supper, but also to its everlasting repetition in commemoration of the Sacrifice of the Cross (see MASS). Rightly, therefore, does the Council of Trent emphasize the intimate connection between the Sacrifice of the Mass and the priesthood (Sess. XXIII, cap. i, in Denzinger, "Enchiridion", 10th ed., 957): "Sacrifice and priesthood are by Divine ordinance so inseparable that they are found together under all laws. Since therefore in the New Testament the Catholic Church has received from the Lord's institution the holy visible sacrifice of the Eucharist it must also be admitted that in the Church there is a new, visible and external priesthood into which the older priesthood has been changed." Surely this logic admits of no reply. It is, then, all the more extraordinary that Harnack should seek the origin of the hierarchical constitution of the Church, not in Palestine, but in pagan Rome. Of the Catholic Church he writes: "She continues ever to govern the peoples; her popes lord it like Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. To Romulus and Remus succeeded Peter and Paul; to the proconsuls the archbishops and bishops. To the legions correspond the hosts of priests and monks; to the imperial bodyguard the Jesuits. Even to the finest details, even to her judicial organization, nay even to her very vestments, the continued influence of the ancient empire and of its institutions may be traced" ("Das Wesen d. Christentums", Leipzig, 1902, p. 157). With the best of good will, we can recognize in this description only a sample of the writer's ingenuity, for an historical investigation of the cited institutions would undoubtedly lead to sources, beginnings, and motives entirely different from the analogous conditions of the Empire of Rome.<br>But the Sacrifice of the Mass indicates only one side of the priesthood; the other side is revealed in the power of forgiving sin, for the exercise of which the priesthood is just as necessary as it is for the power of consecrating and sacrificing. Like the general power to bind and to loose (cf. Matthew 16:19; 18:18), the power of remitting and retaining sins was solemnly bestowed on the Church by Christ (cf. John 20:21 sqq.). Accordingly, the Catholic priesthood has the indisputable right to trace its origin in this respect also to the Divine Founder of the Church. Both sides of the priesthood were brought into prominence by the Council of Trent (loc. cit., n. 961): "If any one shall say that in the New Testament there is no visible and external priesthood nor any power of consecrating and offering the Body and Blood of the Lord, as well as of remitting and retaining sins, but merely the office and bare ministry of preaching the Gospel, let him be anathema." Far from being an "unjustifiable usurpation of Divine powers", the priesthood forms so indispensable a foundation of Christianity that its removal would entail the destruction of the whole edifice. A Christianity without a priesthood cannot be the Church of Christ. This conviction is strengthened by consideration of the psychological impossibility of the Protestant assumption that from the end of the first century onward, Christendom tolerated without struggle or protest the unprecedented usurpation of the priests, who without credentials or testimony suddenly arrogated Divine powers with respect to the Eucharist, and, on the strength of a fictitious appeal to Christ, laid on baptized sinners the grievous burden of public penance as an indispensable condition of the forgiveness of sin.<br>As for the "universal priesthood", on which Protestantism relies in its denial of the special priesthood, it may be said that Catholics also believe in a universal priesthood; this, however, by no means excludes a special priesthood but rather presupposes its existence, since the two are related as the general and the particular, the abstract and the concrete, the figurative and the real. The ordinary Christian cannot be a priest in the strict sense, for he can offer, not a real sacrifice, but only the figurative sacrifice of prayer. For this reason the historical dogmatic development did not and could not follow the course it would have followed if in the primitive Church two opposing trains of thought (i.e. the universal versus the special priesthood) had contended for supremacy until one was vanquished. The history of dogma attests, on the contrary, that both ideas advanced harmoniously through the centuries, and have never disappeared from the Catholic mind. As a matter of fact the profound and beautiful idea of the universal priesthood may be traced from Justin Martyr (Dialogue with Trypho 116), Irenæus, (Against Heresies IV.8.3), and Origen ("De orat.", xxviii, 9; "In Levit.", hom. ix, 1), to Augustine (City of God XX.10) and Leo the Great (Sermo, iv, 1), and thence to St. Thomas (Summa, III, Q. lxxxii, a. 1) and the Roman Catechism. And yet all these writers recognized, along with the Sacrifice of the Mass, the special priesthood in the Church. The origin of the universal priesthood extends back, as is known, to St. Peter, who declares the faithful, in their character of Christians, "a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices", and "a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood" (1 Peter 2:5, 9). But the very text shows that the Apostle meant only a figurative priesthood, since the "spiritual sacrifices" signify prayer and the term "royal" (regale, basileion) could have had but a metaphorical sense for the Christians. The Gnostics, Montanists, and Catharists, who, in their attacks on the special priesthood, had misapplied the metaphor, were just as illogical as the Reformers, since the two ideas, real and figurative priesthood, are quite compatible. It is clear from the foregoing that the Catholic clergy alone are entitled to the designation "priest", since they alone have a true and real sacrifice to offer, the Holy Mass. Consequently, Anglicans who reject the Sacrifice of the Mass are inconsistent, when they refer to their clergy as "priests". The preachers in Germany quite logically disclaim the title with a certain indignation.<br><br>The relation of the priest to the bishop and deacon may be briefly explained by stating that he is, as it were, the middle term between the two, being hierarchically the subordinate of the bishop and the superior of the deacon (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. XXVI, can. vi). While the pre-eminence of the bishop over the priest consists mainly in his power of ordination, that of the priest over the deacon is based on his power of consecrating and absolving (cf. Council of Trent, loc. cit., cap. iv; can. i and vii). The independence of the diaconate appears earlier and more clearly in the oldest sources than that of the priesthood, chiefly because of the long-continued fluctuation in the meaning of the titles episcopus and presbyter, which until the middle of the second century were interchangeable and synonymous terms. Probably there was a reason in fact for this uncertainty, since the hierarchical distinction between bishop and priest seems to have been of gradual growth. Epiphanius (Adv. hær., lxxv, 5) offered an explanation of this condition of uncertainty by supposing that priests were appointed in some places where there was no bishop, while in other places where no candidates for priesthood were found, the people were satisfied with having a bishop, who, however, could not be without a deacon. Cardinal Franzelin ("De eccles. Christi", 2nd ed., Rome, 1907, thes. xvi) gives good grounds for the opinion that in the Bible bishops are indeed named presbyter, but simple priests are never called episcopi. The problem is, however, far from being solved, since in the primitive Church there were not yet fixed names for the different orders; the latter must rather be determined from the context according to the characteristic functions discharged. The appeal to the usage of the pagan Greeks, who had their episkopoi and presbyteroi, does not settle the question, as Ziebarth ("Das griechische Vereinswesen", Leipzig, 1896) has shown in reply to Hatch and Harnack. Any attempt at a solution must take into account the varying use in different countries (e.g. Palestine, Asia Minor). In some places the "presbyters" may have been real bishops, in others priests in the present meaning of the term, while elsewhere they may have been mere administrative officers or worthy elders chosen to represent the local church in its external relations (see HIERARCHY OF THE EARLY CHURCH).<br>Like the Apostolic writings, the "Didache", Hermas, Clement of Rome, and Irenæus often use the terms "bishop" and "priest" indiscriminately. In fact, it is really a moot question whether the presbyterate gradually developed as an offshoot of the episcopate--which is in the nature of things more likely and in view of the needs of the growing Church more readily understood--or whether, conversely, the episcopate had its origin in the elevation of the presbyterate to a higher rank (Lightfoot), which is more difficult to admit. On the other hand, even at the beginning of the second century, Ignatius of Antioch (Ep. ad Magnes., vi and passim) brings out with remarkable clearness the hierarchical distinction between the monarchical bishop, the priests, and the deacons. He emphasizes this triad as essential to the constitution of the Church: "Without these [three] it cannot be called the Church" (Ad Trall., iii). But, according to the law of historic continuity, this distinction of the orders must have existed in substance and embryo during the first century; and, as a matter of fact, St. Paul (1 Timothy 5:17, 19) mentions "presbyters" who were subordinate to the real bishop Timothy. But in the Latin writers there is no ambiguity. Tertullian (On Baptism 17) calls the bishop the "summus sacerdos", under whom are the "presbyteri et diaconi"; and Cyprian (Ep. lxi, 3) speaks of the "presbyteri cum episcopo sacerdotali honore conjuncti", i.e. the priests united by sacerdotal dignity with the bishop (see BISHOP).<br>About 360, after the development of the orders had long been complete, Aërius of Pontus first ventured to obliterate the distinction between the priestly and episcopal orders and to place them on an equality with respect to their powers. For this he was ranked among the heretics by Epiphanius (Adv. hær., lxxv, 3). The testimony of St. Jerome (d. 420), whom the Scottish Presbyterians cite in behalf of the presbyteral constitution of the Church, raises some difficulties, as he appears to assert the full equality of priests and bishops. It is true that Jerome endeavoured to enhance the dignity of the priesthood at the expense of the episcopate and to refer the bishop's superiority "rather to ecclesiastical custom than to Divine regulation" (In Tit., i, 5: "Episcopi noverint se magis consuetudine quam dispositionis dominicæ veritate presbyteris esse majores"). He desired a more democratic constitution in which the priests hitherto undeservedly slighted would participate, and he urged the correction of the abuse, widespread since the third century, by which the archdeacons, as the "right hand" of the bishops, controlled the whole diocesan administration (Ep. cxliv ad Evangel.). It is at once evident that Jerome disputes not the hierarchical rank (potestas ordinis) of the bishops but their powers of government (potestas jurisdictionis)--and this not so much in principle, but only to insist that the deacons should be dislodged from the position they had usurped and the priests established in the official position befitting their higher rank. How far Jerome was from being a follower of Aërius and a forerunner of Presbyterianism appears from his important admission that the power of ordination is possessed by the bishops alone, and not by the priests (loc. cit. in P.L., XXII, 1193: "Quid enim facit--excepta ordinatione--episcopus quod presbyter non faciat?"). By this admission Jerome establishes his orthodoxy.<br><br>The Council of Trent decreed (Sess. XXIII, can. iii, in Denzinger, n. 963): "If any one shall say that order or sacred ordination is not truly and properly a sacrament instituted by Christ our Lord. . .let him be anathema." While the synod defined only the existence of the Sacrament of Holy Orders, without deciding whether all the orders or only some fall within the definition, it is admitted that the priestly ordination possesses with even greater certainty than the episcopal and the diaconal ordination the dignity of a sacrament (cf. Benedict XIV, "De syn. dioces.", VIII, ix, 2). The three essentials of a sacrament—outward sign, interior grace, and institution by Christ—are found in the priestly ordination.<br>As regards the outward sign, there has been a long-protracted controversy among theologians concerning the matter and form, not alone of the priestly ordination, but of the Sacrament of Holy Orders in general. Is the imposition of hands alone (Bonaventure, Morin, and most modern theologians), or the presentation of the instruments (Gregory of Valencia, the Thomists), or are both together (Bellarmine, De Lugo, Billot etc.) to be regarded as the essential matter of the sacrament? As to the priestly ordination in particular, which alone concerns us here, the difference of views is explained by the fact that, in addition to three impositions of hands, the rite includes a presentation to the candidate of the chalice filled with wine, and of the paten with the host. Concerning the latter Eugenius IV says expressly in his "Decretum pro Armenis" (1439; in Denzinger, n. 701): "The priesthood is conferred by the handing of the chalice containing wine and of the paten with bread." However, in view of the fact that in the Bible (Acts 13:3; 14:22; 1 Timothy 4:14; 5:22; 2 Timothy 1:6), in all patristic literature, and in the whole East the imposition of hands alone is found, while even in the West the presentation of the sacred vessels does not extend back beyond the tenth century, we are forced to recognize theoretically that the latter ceremony is unessential, like the solemn anointing of the priest's hands, which is evidently borrowed from the Old Testament and was introduced from the Gallican into the Roman Rite (cf. "Statuta ecclesiæ antiquæ" in P.L., LVI, 879 sqq.). In defence of the anointing, the Council of Trent condemned those who declared it "despicable and pernicious" (Sess. XXXIII, can. v). As regards the sacramental form, it may be accepted as probable that the prayer accompanying the second extension of hands (cheirotonia) is the essential form, although it is not impossible that the words spoken by the bishop during the third imposition of hands (cheirothesia): "Receive the Holy Ghost, whose sins you shall remit, they are remitted, etc.", constitute a partial form. The first imposition of hands by the bishop (and the priests) cannot be regarded as the form, since it is performed in silence, but it also may have an essential importance in so far as the second extension of hands is simply the moral continuation of the first touching of the head of the ordinandus (cf. Gregory IX, "Decret.", I, tit. xvi, cap. III). The oldest formularies--e.g. the "Euchologium" of Serapion of Thmuis (cf. Funk, "Didascalia", II, Tübingen, 1905, 189), the "Pseudo-Apostolic Constitutions" (Funk, loc. cit., I, 520), the lately discovered "Testament of the Lord" (ed. Rahmani, Mainz, 1899, p. 68), and the Canons of Hippolytus (ed. Achelis, Leipzig, 1891, p. 61)--contain only one imposition of hands with a short accompanying prayer. In the eleventh century the Mozarabic Rite is still quite simple (cf. "Monum. liturg.", V, Paris, 1904, pp. 54 sq.), while, on the contrary, the Armenian Rite of the Middle Ages shows great complexity (cf. Conybeare-Maclean, "Rituale Armenorum", Oxford, 1905, pp. 231 sqq.). In the Greek-Byzantine Rite, the bishop, after making three signs of the cross, places his right hand on the head of the ordinandus, meanwhile reciting a prayer, and then, praying in secret, holds the same hand extended above the candidate, and invokes upon him the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost (cf. Goar, "Euchol. Græc.", Paris, 1647, pp. 292 sqq.). For other formularies of ordination see Denzinger, "Ritus Orientalium", II (Würzburg, 1864); Manser in Buchberger, "Kirchliches Handlexikon", s.v. Priesterweihe.<br>As a sacrament of the living, ordination presupposes the possession of sanctifying grace, and therefore confers, besides the right to the actual graces of the priestly office, an increase of sanctifying grace (cf. "Decret. pro Armenis" in Denzinger, n. 701). But in all cases, whether the candidate is in the state of sanctifying grace or not, the sacrament imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. VII, can. ix, in Denzinger, n. 852), i.e. the priestly character, to which are permanently attached the powers of consecrating and absolving—the latter, however, with the reservation that for the valid administration of the Sacrament of Penance the power of jurisdiction is also required (see CHARACTER). As the priestly character, like that imparted by baptism and confirmation, is indelible, ordination can never be repeated, and a return to the lay state is absolutely impossible (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. XXIII, can. iv, in Denzinger, n. 964). That priestly ordination was instituted by Christ is proved not alone by the Divine institution of the priesthood (see above, A), but also by the testimony of Holy Writ and Tradition, which unanimously testify that the Apostles transmitted their powers to their successors, who in turn transmitted them to the succeeding generation (cf. 1 Timothy 5:22). Since the charismatic gifts of the "apostles and prophets" mentioned in the "Didache" had nothing to do with the priesthood as such, these itinerant missionaries still needed the imposition of hands to empower them to discharge the specifically priestly functions (see CHARISMATA).<br>For the valid reception of the Sacrament of Orders, it is necessary that the minister be a bishop and the recipient a baptized person of the male sex. The first requisite is based on the episcopal prerogative of ordaining; the second on the conviction that baptism opens the door to all the other sacraments and that women are definitively barred from the service of the altar (cf. Epiphanius, "De hær.", lxxix, 2). St. Paul is a resolute champion of an exclusively male priesthood (cf. 1 Corinthians 14:34). In this respect there is an essential difference between Christianity and Paganism, since the latter recognizes priestesses as well as priests--e.g. the hierodules of Ancient Greece, the vestal virgins of Rome, the bajaders of India, the wu of China, and the female bonzes of Japan. The early Church condemned as an absurdity the female priesthood of Montanism and of the Collyridiani, and it never regarded the Apostolic institute of deaconesses as a branch of Holy orders. For the licit reception of priestly ordination, canon law demands: freedom from every irregularity, completion of the twenty-fourth year, the reception of the earlier orders (including the diaconate), the observation of the regular interstices, and the possession of a title to ordination.<br>In addition to the requisites for the valid and lawful reception of the priesthood the question arises as to the personal worthiness of the candidate. According to earlier canon law this question was settled by three ballots (scrutinia); it is now decided by official examination and certification. One of the most important means of securing worthy candidates for the priesthood is careful inquiry regarding vocations. Intruders in the sanctuary have at all times been the occasion of the greatest injury to the Church, and of scandal to the people. For this reason, Pope Pius X, with even greater strictness than was shown in previous ecclesiastical regulations, insists upon the exclusion of all candidates who do not give the highest promise of a life conspicuous for firmness of faith and moral rectitude. In this connection the importance and necessity of colleges and ecclesiastical seminaries for the training of the clergy cannot be too strongly emphasized.<br><br>As said above, the official powers of the priest are intimately connected with the sacramental character, indelibly imprinted on his soul. Together with this character is conferred, not only the power of offering up the Sacrifice of the Mass and the (virtual) power of forgiving sins, but also authority to administer extreme unction and, as the regular minister, solemn baptism. Only in virtue of an extraordinary faculty received from the pope is a priest competent to administer the Sacrament of Confirmation. While the conferring of the three sacramental orders of the episcopate, presbyterate, and diaconate, pertains to the bishop alone, the pope may delegate a priest to administer the four minor orders, and even the subdiaconate. According to the present canon law, however, the papal permission granted to abbots of monasteries is confined to the conferring of the tonsure and the four minor orders on their subjects (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. XXIII de Ref., cap. x). Concerning the privilege of conferring the diaconate, claimed to have been given to Cistercian abbots by Innocent VIII in 1489, see Gasparri, "De sacr. ordin.", II (Paris, 1893), n. 798, and Pohle, "Dogmatik", III (4th ed., Paderborn, 1910), pp. 587 sqq. To the priestly office also belongs the faculty of administering the ecclesiastical blessings and the sacramentals in general, in so far as these are not reserved to the pope or bishops. By preaching the Word of God the priest has his share in the teaching office of the Church, always, however, as subordinate to the bishop and only within the sphere of duty to which he is assigned as pastor, curate, etc. Finally, the priest may participate in the pastoral duty in so far as the bishop entrusts him with a definite ecclesiastical office entailing a more or less extensive jurisdiction, which is indispensable especially for the valid absolution of penitents from their sins. Certain external honorary privileges, e.g. those enjoyed by cardinal-priests, prelates, ecclesiastical councillors, etc., do not enhance the intrinsic dignity of the priesthood.<br><br>Passing entirely over the supernatural blessings derived by mankind from the prayers of the priesthood, the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice, and the administration of the sacraments, we shall confine ourselves to the secular civilization, which, through the Catholic priesthood, has spread to all nations and brought into full bloom religion, morality, science, art, and industry. If religion in general is the mother of all culture, Christianity must be acknowledged as the source, measure, and nursery of all true civilization. The Church, the oldest and most successful teacher of mankind, has in each century done pioneer service in all departments of culture. Through her organs, the priests and especially the members of the religious orders, she carried the light of Faith to all lands, banished the darkness of paganism, and with the Gospel brought the blessings of Christian morality and education. What would have become of the countries about the Mediterranean during the epoch of the migration of the nations (from 375) if the popes, bishops, and clergy had not tamed the German hordes, converted them from Arianism to Catholicism, and out of barbarism evolved order? What Ireland owes to St. Patrick, England owes to St. Augustine, who, sent by Pope Gregory the Great, brought not only the Gospel, but also a higher morality and culture. While the light of Christianity thus burned brightly in Ireland and Britain, part of Germany was still shrouded in the darkness of paganism. Bands of missionaries from the Island of Saints now brought to the continent the message of salvation and established new centres of culture. Charlemagne's great work of uniting all the German tribes into an empire was only the glorious fruit of the seed sown by St. Boniface of Certon (d. 755) on German soil and watered with the blood of martyrs. The Church of the Middle Ages, having now attained to power, continued through her priests to propagate the Gospel in pagan lands. It was missionaries who first brought to Europe news of the existence of China. In 1246 three Franciscans, commissioned by the pope, appeared in audience before the emperor of the Mongols; in 1306 the first Christian church was built in Peking. From the Volga to the Desert of Gobi, the Franciscans and Dominicans covered the land with their missionary stations. In the sixteenth century the zeal of the older orders was rivalled by the Jesuits, among whom St. Francis Xavier must be accorded a place of honour; their achievements in the Reductions of Paraguay are as incontestable as their great services in the United States. As for the French colonies in America, the American historian Bancroft declares that no notable city was founded, no river explored, no cape circumnavigated, without a Jesuit showing the way. Even if Buckle's one-sided statement were true, viz. that culture is not the result of religion, but vice versa, we could point to the work of Catholic missionaries, who are striving to lift the savages in pagan lands to a higher state of morality and civilization, and thence to transform them into decent Christians.<br>In the wake of religion follows her inseparable companion, morality; the combination of the two forms is the indispensable preliminary condition for the continuation and vitality of all higher civilization. The decadence of culture has always been heralded by a reign of unbelief and immorality, the fall of the Roman Empire and the French Revolution furnishing conspicuous examples. What the Church accomplished in the course of the centuries for the raising of the standard of morality, in the widest sense, by the inculcation of the Decalogue, that pillar of human society, by promulgating the commandment of love of God and one's neighbour, by preaching purity in single, married, and family life, by waging war upon superstition and evil customs, by the practice of the three counsels of voluntary poverty, obedience, and perfect purity, by holding out the "imitation of Christ" as the ideal of Christian perfection, the records of twenty centuries plainly declare. The history of the Church is at once the history of her charitable activity exercised through the priesthood. There have indeed been waves of degeneracy and immorality sweeping at times even to the papal throne, and resulting in the general corruption of the people, and in apostasy from the Church. The heroic struggle of Gregory VII (d. 1085) against the simony and incontinence of the clergy stands forth as a fact which restored to the stale-grown salt of the earth its earlier strength and flavour.<br>The most wretched and oppressed classes of humanity are the slaves, the poor, and the sick. Nothing is in such harsh contrast to the ideas of human personality and of Christian freedom as the slavery found in pagan lands. The efforts of the Church were at first directed towards depriving slavery of its most repulsive feature by emphasizing the equality and freedom of all children of God (cf. 1 Corinthians 7:21 sqq.; Philemon 16 sqq.), then towards ameliorating as far as possible the condition of slaves, and finally towards effecting the abolition of this unworthy bondage. The slowness of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which owed its final triumph over the African slave-traders to a crusade of Cardinal Lavigerie (d. 1892), is explained by the necessary consideration of the economic rights of the owners and the personal welfare of the slaves themselves, since a bold "proclamation of the rights of man" would simply have thrown millions of helpless slaves breadless into the streets. Emancipation carried with it the obligation of caring for the bodily needs of the freedmen, and, whenever the experiment was made, it was the clergy who undertook this burden. Special congregations, such as the Trinitarians and the Mercedarians, devoted themselves exclusively to the liberation and ransom of prisoners and slaves in pagan, and especially in Mohammedan lands. It was Christian compassion for the weakly and languishing Indians which suggested to the Spanish monk, Las Casas, the unfortunate idea of importing the strong negroes from Africa to work in the American mines. That his idea would develop into the scandalous traffic in the black race, which the history of the three succeeding centuries reveals, the noble monk never suspected (see SLAVERY).<br>As to the relief of the poor and sick, a single priest, St. Vincent de Paul (d. 1660), achieved more in all the branches of this work than many cities and states combined. The services of the clergy in general in the exercise of charity cannot here be touched upon (see CHARITY AND CHARITIES). It may however be noted that the famous School of Salerno, the first and most renowned, and for many centuries the only medical faculty in Europe, was founded by the Benedictines, who here laboured partly as practitioners of medicine, and partly to furnish a supply of skilled physicians for all Europe. Of recent pioneers in the domain of charity and social work may be mentioned the Irish "Apostle of Temperance", Father Theobald Matthew and the German "Father of Journeymen" (Gesellenvater), Kolping.<br>Intimately related with the morally good is the idea of the true and the beautiful, the object of science and art. At all times the Catholic clergy have shown themselves patrons of science and the arts, partly by their own achievements in these fields and partly by their encouragement and support of the work of others. That theology as a science should have found its home among the clergy was but to be expected. However, the whole range of education lay so exclusively in the hands of the priesthood during the Middle Ages, that the ecclesiastical distinction of clericus (cleric) and laicus (layman) developed into the social distinction of educated and ignorant. But for the monks and clerics the ancient classical literature would have been lost. A medieval proverb ran: "A monastery without a library is a castle without an armory." Hume, the philosopher and historian, says: "It is rare that the annals of so uncultivated a people as were the English as well as the other European nations, after the decline of Roman learning, have been transmitted to posterity so complete and with so little mixture of falsehood and fable. This advantage we owe entirely to the clergy of the Church of Rome, who, founding their authority on their superior knowledge, preserved the precious literature of antiquity from a total extinction" (Hume, "Hist. of England", ch. xxiii, Richard III). Among English historians Gildas the Wise, Venerable Bede, and Lingard form an illustrious triumvirate. The idea of scientific progress, first used by Vincent of Lérins with reference to theology and later transferred to the other sciences, is of purely Catholic origin. The modern maxim, "Education for all", is a saying first uttered by Innocent III. Before the foundation of the first universities, which also owed their existence to the popes, renowned cathedral schools and other scientific institutions laboured for the extension of secular knowledge. The father of German public education is Rhabanus Maurus. Of old centres of civilization we may mention among those of the first rank Canterbury, the Island of Iona, Malmesbury, and York in Great Britain; Paris, Orléans, Corbie, Cluny, Chartres, Toul, and Bec in France; Fulda, Reichenau, St. Gall, and Corvey in Germany. The attendance at these universities conducted by clergymen during the Middle Ages awakens one's astonishment: in 1340 the University of Oxford had no less than 30,000 students, and in 1538, when the German universities were almost deserted, about 20,000 students, according to Luther, flocked to Paris.<br>The elementary schools also, wherever they existed, were conducted by priests. Charlemagne had already issued the capitulary "Presbyteri per villas et vicos scholas habeant et cum summa charitate parvulos doceant", i.e. The priests shall have schools in the towns and hamlets and shall teach the children with the utmost devotion. The art of printing was received by the whole Church, from the lowest clergy to the pope, as a "holy art". Almost the whole book production of the fifteenth century aimed at satisfying the taste of the clergy for reading, which thus furthered the development of the book trade. Erasmus complained: "The booksellers declare that before the outbreak of the Reform they disposed of 3000 volumes more quickly than they now sell 600" (see Döllinger, "Die Reformation, ihre innere Entwickelung u. ihre Wirkungen", I, Ratisbon, 1851, p. 348. Early Humanism, strongly encouraged by Popes Nicholas V and Leo X, numbered among its enthusiastic supporters many Catholic clerics, such as Petrarch and Erasmus; the later Humanistic school, steeped in paganism, found among the Catholic priesthood, not encouragement, but to a great extent determined opposition. Spain's greatest writers in the seventeenth century were priests: Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Calderon, etc. At Oxford in the thirteenth century, by their skill in the natural sciences the Franciscans acquired celebrity and the Bishop Grosseteste exercised great influence. The friar, Roger Bacon (d. 1249), was famous for his scientific knowledge, as were also Gerbert of Rheims, afterwards Pope Silvester II, Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lully, and Vincent of Beauvais. Copernicus, canon of Thorn, is the founder of modern astronomy, in which even to the present day the Jesuits especially (e.g. Scheiner, Clavius, Secchi, Perry) have rendered important services. For the first geographical chart or map we are indebted to Fra Mauro of Venice (d. 1459). The Spanish Jesuit, Lorenzo Hervás y Panduro (d. 1809), is the father of comparative philology; the Carmelite, Paolino di san Bartolomeo, was the author of the first Sanskrit grammar (Rome, 1790). The foundation of historical criticism was laid by Cardinal Baronius (d. 1607), the monks of St. Maur, and the Bollandists. A study of the history of art would reveal a proportionately great number of the apostles of the beautiful in art among the Catholic clergy of all centuries. From the paintings in the catacombs to Fra Angelico and thence to the Beuron school we meet numerous priest, less indeed as practicing artists than as Mæcenases of art. The clergy have done much to justify what the celebrated sculptor Canova wrote to Napoleon I: "Art is under infinite obligations to religion, but to none so much as the Catholic religion."<br>The basis on which higher culture finds its secure foundation is material or economic culture, which, in spite of modern technics and machinery, rests ultimately on labour. Without the labourer's energy, which consists in the power and the will to work, no culture whatever can prosper. But the Catholic priesthood more than any other professional body has praised in word and proved by deed the value and blessing of the labour required in agriculture, mining, and the handicrafts. The curse and disdain, which paganism poured on manual labour, were removed by Christianity. Even an Aristotle (Polit., III, iii) could anathematize manual labour as "philistine", the humbler occupations as "unworthy of a free man". To whom are we primarily indebted in Europe for the clearing away of the primitive forests, for schemes of drainage and irrigation, for the cultivation of new fruits and crops, for the building of roads and bridges, if not to the Catholic monks? In Eastern Europe the Basilians, in Western the Benedictines, and later the Cistercians and Trappists, laboured to bring the land under cultivation, and rendered vast districts free from fever and habitable. Mining and foundries also owe their development, and to some extent their origin, to the keen economic sense of the monasteries. To place the whole economic life of the nations on a scientific foundation, Catholic bishops and priests early laid the basis of the science of national economy--e.g. Duns Scotus (d. 1308), Nicholas Oresme, Bishop of Lisieux (d. 1382), St. Antoninus of Florence (d. 1459), and Gabriel Biel (d. 1495). The Church and clergy have therefore truly endeavoured to carry out in every sphere and in all centuries the programme which Leo XIII in his famous Encyclical "Immortale Dei" of 1 Nov., 1885, declared the ideal of the Catholic Church: "Imo inertiæ desidiæque inimica [Ecclesia] magnopere vult, ut hominum ingenia uberes ferant exercitatione et cultura fructus". The "flight from the world", with which they are so constantly reproached, or the "hostility to civilization", which we hear so often echoed by the ignorant, have never prevented the Church or her clergy from fulfilling their calling as a civilizing agency of the first order, and thus refuting all slanders with the logic of facts.<br><br>PAGAN PRIESTHOOD: Of the vast literature only a few fundamental works can be cited:<br>

 <br><br>Having established by inductive inference the self-existence of a personal First Cause distinct from matter and from the human mind (see EXISTENCE OF GOD), we now proceed by deductive analysis to examine the nature and attributes of this Being to the extent required by our limited philosophical scope. We will treat accordingly of<br>
<br>the infinity,
<br>unity or unicity, and
<br>simplicity of God, adding
<br>some remarks on Divine personality.
<br><br>When we say that God is infinite, we mean that He is unlimited in every kind of perfection or that every conceivable perfection belongs to Him in the highest conceivable way. In a different sense we sometimes speak, for instance, of infinite time or space, meaning thereby time of such indefinite duration or space of such indefinite extension that we cannot assign any fixed limit to one or the other. Care should be taken not to confound these two essentially different meanings of the term. Time and space, being made up of parts in duration or extension, are essentially finite by comparison with God's infinity. Now we assert that God is infinitely perfect in the sense explained, and that His infinity is deducible from His self-existence. For a self-existent being, if limited at all, could be limited only by itself; to be limited by another would imply causal dependence on that other, which the very notion of self-existence excludes. But the self-existing cannot be conceived as limiting itself, in the sense of curtailing its perfection of being, without ceasing to be self-existing. Whatever it is, it is necessarily; its own essence is the sole reason or explanation of its existence, so that its manner of existence must be as unchangeable as its essence, and to suggest the possibility of an increase or diminution of perfection would be to suggest the absurdity of a changeable essence. It only remains, then, to say that whatever perfection is compatible with its essence is actually realized in a self-existing being; but as there is no conceivable perfection as such — that is, no expression of positive being as such — that is not compatible with the essence of the self-existent, it follows that the self-existent must be infinite in all perfection. For self-existence itself is absolute positive being and positive being cannot contradict, and cannot therefore limit, positive being.<br>This general, and admittedly very abstract, conclusion, as well as the reasoning which supports it, will be rendered more intelligible by a brief specific illustration of what it involves.<br>(i) When, in speaking of the Infinite, we attribute all conceivable perfections to Him, we must not forget that the predicates we employ to describe perfections derive their meaning and connotation in the first instance from their application to finite beings; and on reflection it is seen that we must distinguish between different kinds of perfections, and that we cannot without palpable contradiction attribute all the perfections of creatures in the same way to God. Some perfections are such that even in the abstract, they necessarily imply or connote finiteness of being or imperfection; while some others do not of themselves necessarily connote imperfection. To the first class belong all material perfections — extension, sensibility and the like — and certain spiritual perfections such as rationality (as distinct from simple intelligence); to the second class belong such perfections as being truth, goodness, intelligence, wisdom, justice, holiness, etc. Now while it cannot be said that God is infinitely extended, or that He feels or reasons in an infinite way, it can be said that He is infinitely good, intelligent, wise, just, holy, etc. — in other words, while perfections of the second class are attributed to God formally (i.e., without any change in the proper meaning of the predicates which express them), those of the first class can only be attributed to Him eminently and equivalently, (i.e. whatever positive being they express belongs to God as their cause in a much higher and more excellent way than to the creatures in which they formally exist). By means of this important distinction, which Agnostics reject or neglect, we are able to think and to speak of the Infinite without being guilty of contradiction, and the fact that men generally — even Agnostics themselves when off their guard — recognize and use the distinction, is the best proof that it is pertinent and well founded. Ultimately it is only another way of saying that, given an infinite cause and finite effects, whatever pure perfection is discovered in the effects must first exist in the cause (via affirmationis) and at the same time that whatever imperfection is discovered in the effects must be excluded from the cause (via negationis vel exclusionis). These two principles do not contradict, but only balance and correct one another.<br>(ii) Yet sometimes men are led by a natural tendency to think and speak of God as if He were a magnified creature — more especially a magnified man — and this is known as anthropomorphism. Thus God is said to see or hear, as if He had physical organs, or to be angry or sorry, as if subject to human passions: and this perfectly legitimate and more or less unavoidable use of metaphor is often quite unfairly alleged to prove that the strictly Infinite is unthinkable and unknowable, and that it is really a finite anthropomorphic God that men worship. But whatever truth there may be in this charge as applied to Polytheistic religions, or even to the Theistic beliefs of rude and uncultured minds, it is untrue and unjust when directed against philosophical Theism. The same reasons that justify and recommend the use of metaphorical language in other connections justify and recommended it here, but no Theist of average intelligence ever thinks of understanding literally the metaphors he applies, or hears applied by others, to God, any more than he means to speak literally when he calls a brave man a lion, or a cunning one a fox.<br>(iii) Finally it should be observed that, while predicating pure perfections literally both of God and of creatures, it is always understood that these predicates are true in an infinitely higher sense of God than of creatures, and that there is no thought of coordinating or classifying God with creatures. This is technically expressed by saying that all our knowledge of God is analogical, and that all predicates applied to God and to creatures are used analogically, not univocally. I may look at a portrait or at its living original, and say of either, with literal truth, that is a beautiful face. And this is an example of analogical predication. Beauty is literally and truly realized both in the portrait and its living original, and retains its proper meaning as applied to either; there is sufficient likeness or analogy to justify literal predication but there is not that perfect likeness or identity between painted and living beauty which univocal predication would imply. And similarly in the case of God and creatures. What we contemplate directly is the portrait of Him painted, so to speak, by Himself on the canvas of the universe and exhibiting in a finite degree various perfections, which, without losing their proper meaning for us, are seen to be capable of being realized in an infinite degree; and our reason compels us to infer that they must be and are so realized in Him who is their ultimate cause.<br>Hence we admit, in conclusion, that our knowledge of the Infinite is inadequate, and necessarily so since our minds are only finite. But this is very different from the Agnostic contention that the Infinite is altogether unknowable, and that the statements of Theists regarding the nature and attributes of God are so many plain contradictions. It is only by ignoring the well-recognized rules of predication that have just been explained, and consequently by misunderstanding and misrepresenting the Theistic position, that Agnostics succeed in giving an air of superficial plausibility to their own philosophy of blank negation. Anyone who understands those rules, and has learned to think clearly, and trusts his own reason and common sense, will find it easy to meet and refute Agnostic arguments, most of which, in principle, have been anticipated in what precedes. Only one general observation need be made here — that the principles to which the Agnostic philosopher must appeal in his attempt to invalidate religious knowledge would, if consistently applied, invalidate all human knowledge and lead to universal scepticism — and it is safe to say that, unless absolute scepticism becomes the philosophy of mankind, Agnosticism will never supplant religion.<br><br>Obviously there can be only one infinite being, only one God. If several were to exist, none of them would really be infinite, for, to have plurality of natures at all, each should have some perfection not possessed by the others. This will be readily granted by every one who admits the infinity of God, and there is no need to delay in developing what is perfectly clear. It should be noted, however, that some Theistic philosophers prefer to deduce unicity from self-existence and infinity from both combined, and in a matter so very abstract it is not surprising that slight differences of opinion should arise. But we have followed what seems to us to be the simpler and clearer line of argument. The metaphysical argument by which unicity, as distinct from infinity, is deduced from self-existence seems to be very obscure, while on the other hand infinity, as distinct from unicity, seems to be clearly implied in self-existence as such. If the question, for example, be asked: Why may there not be several self-existing beings? The only satisfactory answer, as it seems to us, is this: Because a self-existent being as such is necessarily infinite, and there cannot be several infinities. The unity of God as the First Cause might also be inductively inferred from the unity of the universe as we know it; but as the suggestion might be made, and could not be disproved, that there may be another or even several universes of which we have no knowledge, this argument would not be absolutely conclusive.<br><br>God is a simple being or substance excluding every kind of composition, physical or metaphysical. Physical or real composition is either substantial or accidental — substantial, if the being in question consists of two or more substantial principles, forming parts of a composite whole, as man for example, consists of body and soul; accidental, if the being in question, although simple in its substance (as is the human soul), is capable of possessing accidental perfections (like the actual thoughts and volition of man's soul) not necessarily identical with its substance. Now it is clear that an infinite being cannot be substantially composite, for this would mean that infinity is made up of the union or addition of finite parts — a plain contradiction in terms. Nor can accidental composition be attributed to the infinite since even this would imply a capacity for increased perfection, which the very notion of the infinite excludes. There is not, therefore, and cannot be any physical or real composition in God.<br>Neither can there be that kind of composition which is known as metaphysical, and which results from "the union of diverse concepts referring to the same real thing in such a way that none of them by itself signifies either explicitly or even implicitly the whole reality signified by their combination." Thus every actual contingent being is a metaphysical compound of essence and existence, and man in particular, according to the definition, is a compound of animal and rational. Essence as such in relation to a contingent being merely implies its conceivableness or possibility, and abstracts from actual existence; existence as such must be added before we can speak of the being as actual. But this distinction, with the composition it implies, cannot be applied to the self-existent or infinite being in whom essence and existence are completely identified. We say of a contingent being that it has a certain nature or essence, but of the self-existent we say that it is its own nature or essence. There is no composition therefore of essence and existence — or of potentiality and actuality — in God, nor can the composition of genus and specific difference, implied for example in the definition of man as a rational animal, be attributed to Him. God cannot be classified or defined, as contingent beings are classified and defined; for there is no aspect of being in which He is perfectly similar to the finite, and consequently no genus in which He can be included. From this it follows that we cannot know God adequately in the way in which He knows Himself, but not, as the Agnostic contends, that our inadequate knowledge is not true as far as it goes. In speaking of a being who transcends the limitations of formal logical definition our propositions are an expression of real truth, provided that what we state is in itself intelligible and not self-contradictory; and there is nothing unintelligible or contradictory in what Theists predicate of God. It is true that no single predicate is adequate or exhaustive as a description of His infinite perfection, and that we need to employ a multitude of predicates, as if at first sight infinity could be reached by multiplication. But at the same time we recognize that this is not so — being repugnant to the Divine simplicity; and that while truth, goodness, wisdom, holiness and other attributes, as we conceive and define them express perfections that are formally distinct, yet as applied to God they are all ultimately identical in meaning and describe the same ultimate reality — the one infinitely perfect and simple being.<br><br>When we say that God is a personal being we mean that He is intelligent and free and distinct from the created universe. Personality as such expresses perfection, and if human personality as such connotes imperfection, it must be remembered that, as in the case of similar predicates, this connotation is excluded when we attribute personality to God. It is principally by way of opposition to Pantheism that Divine personality is emphasized by the Theistic philosopher. Human personality, as we know it, is one of the primary data of consciousness, and it is one of those created perfections which must be realized formally (although only analogically) in the First Cause. But Pantheism would require us to deny the reality of any such perfection, whether in creatures or in the Creator, and this is one of the fundamental objections to any form of Pantheistic teaching. Regarding the mystery of the Trinity or three Divine Persons in God, which can be known only by revelation, it is enough to say here that properly understood the mystery contains no contradiction, but on the contrary adds much that is helpful to our inadequate knowledge of the infinite.<br><br>Reason, as we have seen, teaches that God is one simple and infinitely perfect spiritual substance or nature. Sacred Scripture and the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teach the same. The creeds, for example, usually begin with a profession of faith in the one true God, Who is the Creator and Lord of heaven and earth, and is also, in the words of the Vatican Council, "omnipotent, eternal, immense, incomprehensible, infinite in intellect and will and in every perfection" (Sess. III, cap. i, De Deo). The best way in which we can describe the Divine nature is to say that it is infinitely perfect, or that God is the infinitely perfect Being; but we must always remember that even being itself, the most abstract and universal term we possess, is predicated of God and of creatures not univocally or identically, but only analogically. But other predicates, which, as applied to creatures, express certain specific determinations of being, are also used of God — analogically, if in themselves they express pure or unmixed perfection, but only metaphorically if they necessarily connote imperfection. Now of such predicates as applied to creatures we distinguish between those that are used in the concrete to denote being as such more or less determined (v.g., substance, spirit, etc.), and those that are used in the abstract or adjectively to denote determinations, or qualities, or attributes of being (v.g., good, goodness; intelligent, intelligence, etc.); and we find it useful to transfer this distinction to God, and to speak of the Divine nature or essence and Divine attributes being careful at the same time, by insisting on Divine simplicity, to avoid error or contradiction in its application. For, as applied to God, the distinction between nature and attributes, and between the attributes themselves, is merely logical and not real. The finite mind is not capable of comprehending the Infinite so as adequately to describe its essence by any single concept or term; but while using a multitude of terms, all of which are analogically true, we do not mean to imply that there is any kind of composition in God. Thus, as applied to creatures, goodness and justice, for example, are distinct from each other and from the nature or substance of the beings in whom they are found, and if finite limitations compel us to speak of such perfections in God as if they were similarly distinct, we know, nevertheless, and are ready, when needful, to explain, that this is not really so, but that all Divine attributes are really identical with one another and with the Divine essence.## As known through natural reason ("the God of the philosophers")<br>Having established by inductive inference the self-existence of a personal First Cause distinct from matter and from the human mind (see EXISTENCE OF GOD), we now proceed by deductive analysis to examine the nature and attributes of this Being to the extent required by our limited philosophical scope. We will treat accordingly of<br>
<br>the infinity,
<br>unity or unicity, and
<br>simplicity of God, adding
<br>some remarks on Divine personality.
<br><br>When we say that God is infinite, we mean that He is unlimited in every kind of perfection or that every conceivable perfection belongs to Him in the highest conceivable way. In a different sense we sometimes speak, for instance, of infinite time or space, meaning thereby time of such indefinite duration or space of such indefinite extension that we cannot assign any fixed limit to one or the other. Care should be taken not to confound these two essentially different meanings of the term. Time and space, being made up of parts in duration or extension, are essentially finite by comparison with God's infinity. Now we assert that God is infinitely perfect in the sense explained, and that His infinity is deducible from His self-existence. For a self-existent being, if limited at all, could be limited only by itself; to be limited by another would imply causal dependence on that other, which the very notion of self-existence excludes. But the self-existing cannot be conceived as limiting itself, in the sense of curtailing its perfection of being, without ceasing to be self-existing. Whatever it is, it is necessarily; its own essence is the sole reason or explanation of its existence, so that its manner of existence must be as unchangeable as its essence, and to suggest the possibility of an increase or diminution of perfection would be to suggest the absurdity of a changeable essence. It only remains, then, to say that whatever perfection is compatible with its essence is actually realized in a self-existing being; but as there is no conceivable perfection as such — that is, no expression of positive being as such — that is not compatible with the essence of the self-existent, it follows that the self-existent must be infinite in all perfection. For self-existence itself is absolute positive being and positive being cannot contradict, and cannot therefore limit, positive being.<br>This general, and admittedly very abstract, conclusion, as well as the reasoning which supports it, will be rendered more intelligible by a brief specific illustration of what it involves.<br>(i) When, in speaking of the Infinite, we attribute all conceivable perfections to Him, we must not forget that the predicates we employ to describe perfections derive their meaning and connotation in the first instance from their application to finite beings; and on reflection it is seen that we must distinguish between different kinds of perfections, and that we cannot without palpable contradiction attribute all the perfections of creatures in the same way to God.

But among them some are recognized as being of fundamental importance, and to these in particular is the term attributes applied and special notice devoted by <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s — though there is no rigid agreement as to the number or classification of such attributes. As good a classification as any other is that based on the analogy of entitative and operative perfections in creatures — the former qualifying nature or essence as such and abstracting from activity, the latter referring especially to the activity of the nature in question. Another distinction is often made between physical, and moral or ethical, attributes — the former of themselves abstracting from, while the latter directly express, moral perfection. But without labouring with the question of classification, it will suffice to notice separately those attributes of leading importance that have not been already explained. Nothing need be added to what has been said above concerning self-existence, infinity, unity, and simplicity (which belong to the entitative class); but eternity, immensity, and immutability (also of the entitative class), together with the active attributes, whether physical or moral, connected with the Divine intellect and will, call for some explanation here.<br><br>By saying that God is eternal we mean that in essence, life, and action He is altogether beyond temporal limits and relations. He has neither beginning, nor end, nor duration by way of sequence or succession of moments. There is no past or future for God — but only an eternal present. If we say that He was or that He acted, or that He will be or will act, we mean in strictness that He is or that He acts; and this truth is well expressed by Christ when He says (John 8:58 — A.V.): "Before Abraham was, I am." Eternity, therefore, as predicated of God, does not mean indefinite duration in time — a meaning in which the term is sometimes used in other connections — but it means the total exclusion of the finiteness which time implies. We are obliged to use negative language in describing it, but in itself eternity is a positive perfection, and as such may be best defined in the words of Boethius as being "interminabilis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio," i.e. possession in full entirety and perfection of life without beginning, end, or succession.<br>The eternity of God is a corollary from His self-existence and infinity. Time being a measure of finite existence, the infinite must transcend it. God, it is true, coexists with time, as He coexists with creatures, but He does not exist in time, so as to be subject to temporal relations: His self-existence is timeless. Yet the positive perfection expressed by duration as such, i.e. persistence and permanence of being, belongs to God and is truly predicated of Him, as when He is spoken of, for example, as "Him that is, and that was and that is to come" (Revelation 1:4); but the strictly temporal connotation of such predicates must always be corrected by recalling the true notion of eternity.<br><br>Space, like time, is one of the measures of the finite, and as by the attribute of eternity, we describe God's transcendence of all temporal limitations, so by the attribute of immensity we express His transcendent relation to space. There is this difference, however, to be noted between eternity and immensity, that the positive aspect of the latter is more easily realized by us, and is sometimes spoken of, under the name of omnipresence, or ubiquity, as if it were a distinct attribute. Divine immensity means on the one hand that God is necessarily present everywhere in space as the immanent cause and sustainer of creatures, and on the other hand that He transcends the limitations of actual and possible space, and cannot be circumscribed or measured or divided by any spatial relations. To say that God is immense is only another way of saying that He is both immanent and transcendent in the sense already explained. As some one has metaphorically and paradoxically expressed it, "God's centre is everywhere, His circumference nowhere."<br>That God is not subject to spatial limitations follows from His infinite simplicity; and that He is truly present in every place or thing — that He is omnipresent or ubiquitous — follows from the fact that He is the cause and ground of all reality. According to our finite manner of thinking we conceive this presence of God in things spatial as being primarily a presence of power and operation — immediate Divine efficiency being required to sustain created beings in existence and to enable them to act; but, as every kind of Divine action ad extra is really identical with the Divine nature or essence, it follows that God is really present everywhere in creation not merely per virtuten et operationem, but per essentiam. In other words God Himself, or the Divine nature, is in immediate contact with, or immanent in, every creature — conserving it in being and enabling it to act. But while insisting on this truth we must, if we would avoid contradiction, reject every form of the pantheistic hypothesis. While emphasizing Divine immanence we must not overlook Divine transcendence.<br>There is no lack of Scriptural or ecclesiastical testimonies asserting God's immensity and ubiquity. It is enough to refer for example to:<br><br>In God "there is no change, nor shadow of alteration" (James 1:17); "They [i.e. "the works of thy hands"] shall perish, but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment. And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the selfsame and thy years shall not fail" (Hebrews 1:10-12, Psalm 101:26-28. Cf. Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8). These are some of the Scriptural texts which clearly teach Divine immutability or unchangeableness, and this attribute is likewise emphasized in <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teaching, as by the Council of Nicaea against the Arians, who attributed mutability to the Logos (Denzinger, 54-old No. 18), and by the Vatican Council in its famous definition.<br>That the Divine nature is essentially immutable, or incapable of any internal change, is an obvious corollary from Divine infinity. Changeableness implies the capacity for increase or diminution of perfection, that is, it implies finiteness and imperfection. But God is infinitely perfect and is necessarily what He is. It is true that some attributes by which certain aspects of Divine perfection are described are hypothetical or relative, in the sense that they presuppose the contingent fact of creation: omnipresence, for example, presupposes the actual existence of spatial beings. But it is obvious that the mutability implied in this belongs to creatures, and not to the Creator; and it is a strange confusion of thought that has led some modern Theists — even professing Christians — to maintain that such attributes can be laid aside by God, and that the Logos in becoming incarnate actually did lay them aside, or at least ceased from their active exercise. But as creation itself did not affect the immutability of God, so neither did the incarnation of a Divine Person; whatever change was involved in either case took place solely in the created nature.<br><br>The so-called active Divine attributes are best treated in connection with the Divine Intellect and Will — principles of Divine operation ad extra — to which they are all ultimately reducible.<br><br>Description of the Divine Knowledge<br>That God is omniscient or possesses the most perfect knowledge of all things, follows from His infinite perfection. In the first place He knows and comprehends Himself fully and adequately, and in the next place He knows all created objects and comprehends their finite and contingent mode of being. Hence He knows them individually or singularly in their finite multiplicity, knows everything possible as well as actual; knows what is bad as well as what is good. Everything, in a word, which to our finite minds signifies perfection and completeness of knowledge may be predicated of Divine omniscience, and it is further to be observed that it is on Himself alone that God depends for His knowledge. To make Him in any way dependent on creatures for knowledge of created objects would destroy His infinite perfection and supremacy. Hence it is in His eternal, unchangeable, comprehensive knowledge of Himself or of His own infinite being that God knows creatures and their acts, whether there is question of what is actual or merely possible. Indeed, Divine knowledge itself is really identical with Divine essence, as are all the attributes and acts of God; but according to our finite modes of thought we feel the need of conceiving them distinctly and of representing the Divine essence as the medium or mirror in which the Divine intellect sees all truth. Moreover, although the act of Divine knowledge is infinitely simple in itself, we feel the need of further distinctions — not as regards the knowledge in itself, but as regards the multiplicity of finite objects which it embraces. Hence the universally recognized distinction between the knowledge of vision (scientia visionis) and that of simple intelligence (simplicis intelligentiae), and the famous controversy regarding the scientia media. We shall briefly explain this distinction and the chief difficulties involved in this controversy.<br>Distinctions in the Divine Knowledge<br>In classifying the objects of Divine omniscience the most obvious and fundamental distinction is between things that actually exist at any time, and those that are merely possible. And it is in reference to these two classes of objects that the distinction is made between knowledge "of vision" and "of simple intelligence"; the former referring to things actual, and the latter to the merely possible. This distinction might appear at first sight to be absolutely comprehensive and adequate to the purpose for which we introduce distinctions at all, but some difficulty is felt once the question is raised of God's knowledge of the acts of creatures endowed with free will. That God knows infallibly and from eternity what, for example, a certain man, in the exercise of free will, will do or actually does in any given circumstances, and what he might or would actually have done in different circumstances is beyond doubt — being a corollary from the eternal actuality of Divine knowledge. So to speak, God has not to wait on the contingent and temporal event of the man's free choice to know what the latter's action will be; He knows it from eternity. But the difficulty is: how, from our finite point of view, to interpret and explain the mysterious manner of God's knowledge of such events without at the same time sacrificing the free will of the creature.<br>The Dominican school has defended the view that the distinction between knowledge of "vision" and of "simple intelligence" is the only one we need or ought to employ in our effort to conceive and describe Divine omniscience, even in relation to the free acts of intelligent creatures. These acts, if they ever take place, are known or foreknown by God as if they were eternally actual — and this is admitted by all; otherwise they remain in the category of the merely possible — and this is what the Jesuit school denies, pointing for example to statements such as that of Christ regarding the people of Tyre and Sidon, who would have done penance had they received the same graces as the Jews (Matthew 11:21). This school therefore maintains that to the actual as such and the purely possible we must add another category of objects: hypothetical facts that may never become actual, but would become actual were certain conditions realized. The hypothetical truth of such facts, it is rightly contended, is more than mere possibility, yet less than actuality; and since God knows such facts in their hypothetical character there is good reason for introducing a distinction to cover them — and this is the scientia media. And it is clear that even acts that take place and as such fall finally under the knowledge of vision may be conceived as falling first under the knowledge of simple intelligence and then under the scientia media, the progressive formula would be:<br>
<br>first, it is possible Peter would do so and so;
<br>second, Peter would do so and so, given certain conditions;
<br>third, Peter will do or does so and so.
<br>Now, were it not for the differences that lie behind there would probably be no objection raised to scientia media, but the distinction itself is only the prelude to the real problem. Admitting that God knows from eternity the future free acts of creatures the question is how or in what way He knows them or rather how we are to conceive and explain by analogy the manner of the divine foreknowledge, which in itself is beyond our powers of comprehension? It is admitted that God knows them first as objects of the knowledge of simple intelligence; but does he know them also as objects of the scientia media, i.e. hypothetically and independently of any decree of His will, determining their actuality, or does He know them only in and through such decrees? The Dominican contention is that God's knowledge of future free acts depends on the decrees of His free will which predetermine their actuality by means of the praemotio physica. God knows, for example, that Peter will do so and so, because He has decreed from eternity so to move Peter's free will that the latter will infallibly, although freely, cooperate with, or consent to, the Divine premotion. In the case of good acts there is a physical and intrinsic connection between the motion given by God and the consent of Peter's will, while as regards morally bad acts, the immorality as such — which is a privation and not a positive entity — comes entirely from the created will.<br>The principal difficulties against this view are that in the first place it seems to do away with human free will, and in the next place to make God responsible for sin. Both consequences of course are denied by those who uphold it, but, making all due allowance for the mystery which shrouds the subject, it is difficult to see how the denial of free will is not logically involved in the theory of the praemotio physica, how the will can be said to consent freely to a motion which is conceived as predetermining consent; such explanations as are offered merely amount to the assertion that, after all, the human will is free. The other difficulty consists in the twofold fact that God is represented as giving the praemotio physica in the natural order for the act of will by which the sinner embraces evil, and that He withholds the supernatural praemotio or efficacious grace which is essentially required for the performance of a salutary act. The Jesuit school, on the other hand — with whom probably a majority of independent <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s agree — using the scientia media maintains that we ought to conceive God's knowledge of future free acts not as being dependent and consequent upon decrees of His will, but in its character as hypothetical knowledge or being antecedent to them. God knows in the scientia media what Peter would do if in given circumstances he were to receive a certain aid, and this before any absolute decree to give that aid is supposed. Thus there is no predetermination by the Divine of what the human will freely chooses; it is not because God foreknows (having foredecreed) a certain free act that that act takes place, but God foreknows it in the first instance because as a matter of fact it is going to take place; He knows it as a hypothetical objective fact before it becomes an object of the scientia visionis — or rather this is how, in order to safeguard human liberty, we must conceive Him as knowing it. It was thus, for example, that Christ knew what would have been the results of His ministry among the people of Tyre and Sidon. But one must be careful to avoid implying that God's knowledge is in any way dependent on creatures, as if He had, so to speak, to await the actual event in time before knowing infallibly what a free creature may choose to do. From eternity He knows, but does not predetermine the creature's choice. And if it be asked how we can conceive this knowledge to exist antecedently to and independently of some act of the Divine will, on which all things contingent depend, we can only say that the objective truth expressed by the hypothetical facts in question is somehow reflected in the Divine Essence, which is the mirror of all truth, and that in knowing Himself God knows these things also. Whichever way we turn we are bound ultimately to encounter a mystery, and, when there is a question of choosing between a theory which refers the mystery to God Himself and one which only saves the truth of human freedom by making free-will itself a mystery, most <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s naturally prefer the former alternative.<br><br>Description of the Divine Will<br>(a) The highest perfections of creatures are reducible to functions of intellect and will, and, as these perfections are realized analogically in God, we naturally pass from considering Divine knowledge or intelligence to the study of Divine volition. The object of intellect as such is the true; the object of will as such, the good. In the case of God it is evident that His own infinite goodness is the primary and necessary object of His will, created goodness being but a secondary and contingent object. This is what the inspired writer means when he says: "The Lord hath made all things for himself" (Proverbs 16:4). The Divine will of course, like the Divine intellect, is really identical with the Divine Essence but according to our finite modes of thought we are obliged to speak of them as if they were distinct and, just as the Divine intellect cannot be dependent on created objects for its knowledge of them, neither can the Divine will be so dependent for its volition. Had no creature ever been created, God would have been the same self-sufficient being that He is, the Divine will as an appetitive faculty being satisfied with the infinite goodness of the Divine Essence itself. This is what the Vatican Council means by speaking of God as "most happy in and by Himself" — not that He does not truly wish and love the goodness of creatures, which is a participation of His own, but that He has no need of creatures and is in no way dependent on them for His bliss.<br>(b) Hence it follows that God possesses the perfection of free will in an infinitely eminent degree. That is to say, without any change in Himself or in His eternal act of volition, He freely chooses whether or not creatures shall exist and what manner of existence shall be theirs, and this choice or determination is an exercise of that dominion which free will (liberty of indifference) essentially expresses. In itself free will is an absolute and positive perfection, and as such is most fully realized in God. Yet we are obliged to describe Divine liberty as we have done relatively to its effects in creation, and, by way of negation, we must exclude the imperfections associated with free will in creatures. These imperfections may be reduced to two:<br>
<br>potentiality and mutability as opposed to immutable pure act, and
<br>the power of choosing what is evil.
<br>Only the second need be noticed here.<br>(c) When a free creature chooses what is evil, he does not choose it formally as such, but only sub specie boni, i.e., what his will really embraces is some aspect of goodness which he truly or falsely believes to be discoverable in the evil act. Moral evil ultimately consists in choosing some such fancied good which is known more or less clearly to be opposed to the Supreme Good, and it is obvious that only a finite being can be capable of such a choice. God necessarily loves Himself, who is the Supreme Good, and cannot wish anything that would be opposed to Himself. Yet He permits the sins of creatures, and it has always been considered one of the gravest problems of theism to explain why this is so. We cannot enter on the Problem here, but must content ourselves with a few brief observations.<br>
<br>First, however difficult or even mysterious, may be the problem of moral evil for the theist, it is many times more difficult for every kind of anti-theist.
<br>Secondly, so far as we can judge the possibility of moral defection seems to be a natural limitation of created free will, and can only be excluded supernaturally, and, even viewing the question from a purely rational standpoint, we are conscious on the whole that, whatever the final solution may be, it is better that God should have created free beings capable of sinning than that He should not have created free beings at all. Few men would resign the faculty of free will just to escape the danger of abusing it.
<br>Thirdly, some final solution, not at present apparent to our limited intelligence, may be expected on merely rational grounds from the infinite wisdom and justice of God, and supernatural revelation, which gives us glimpses of the Divine plan, goes a long way towards supplying a complete answer to the questions that most intimately concern us. The clearly perceived truth to be emphasized here is that sin is hateful to God and essentially opposed to His infinite holiness, and that the wilful discord which sin introduces into the harmony of the universe will somehow be set right in the end.
<br>There is no need to delay in discussing mere physical as distinct from moral evil, and it is enough to remark that such evil is not merely permitted, but willed by God, not indeed in its character as evil, but as being, in such a universe as the present, a means towards good and in itself relatively good.<br>Distinctions in the Divine Will<br>As distinctions are made in the Divine knowledge, so also in the Divine will, and one of these latter is of sufficient importance to deserve a passing notice here. This is the distinction between the antecedent and consequent will, and its principal application is to the question of man's salvation. God, according to St. Paul (1 Timothy 2:4),"wills that all men be saved", and this is explained to be an antecedent will; that is to say, abstracting from circumstances and conditions which may interfere with the fulfilment of God's will (e.g., sin on man's part, natural order in the universe, etc.), He has a sincere wish that all men should attain supernatural salvation, and this will is so far efficacious that He provides and intends the necessary means of salvation for all — sufficient actual graces for those who are capable of cooperating with them and the Sacrament of Baptism for infants. On the other hand, the consequent will takes account of those circumstances and conditions and has reference to what God wills and executes in consequence of them. It is thus, for example, that He condemns the wicked to punishment after death and excludes unbaptized infants from the beatific vision.<br><br>Several attributes and several aspects of Divine activity partake both of an intellectual and a volitional character and must be treated from the combined point of view. Such are omnipotence, holiness, justice, blessedness, and so forth, but it is unnecessary to delay on such attributes which are self-explanatory. Some notice, on the other hand, must be devoted to providence and to the particular aspects of providence which we call predestination and reprobation; and with a brief treatment of these which are elsewhere fully treated this article will be concluded.<br>Providence<br>Providence may be defined as the scheme in the Divine mind by which all things treated are ordered and guided efficiently to a common end or purpose (ratio perductionis rerum in finem in mente divina existens). It includes an act of intellect and an act of will, in other words knowledge and power. And that there is such a thing as Divine Providence by which the entire universe is ruled clearly follows from the fact that God is the author of all things and that order and purpose must characterize the action of an intelligent creator. Nor is any truth more insistently proclaimed in revelation. What the author of Wisdom (xiv, 3) says of a particular thing is applicable to the universe as a whole: "But your providence, O Father, governs it", and no more beautiful illustration of the same truth has ever been given than that given by Christ Himself when He instances God's care for the birds of the air and the lilies of the field (Matthew 6:25 sq.). But to rational creatures God's providential care is extended in a very special way, yet not so as to do away with the utility and efficacy of prayer, whether for temporal or spiritual favours (Matthew 7:8), nor to disturb or override the efficiency of secondary causes. It is in and through secondary causes that providence ordinarily works, and no miracle, as a rule, is to be expected in answer to prayer<br>Predestination and reprobation<br>Predestination and reprobation are those special parts of Divine Providence which deal specially with man's salvation or damnation in the present supernatural order. Predestination is the foreknowledge on the part of God of those who will de facto be saved and the preparation and bestowal of the means by which salvation is obtained, while reprobation is the foreknowledge of those who will de facto be damned and the permission of this eventuality by God. In both cases an act of the intellect (infallible foreknowledge), and an act of the will are supposed; but whereas in predestination the antecedent and consequent will is the same, in reprobation God wills consequently what He does not antecedently will at all but only permits, namely, the eternal punishment of the sinner.<br>Many controversies have arisen on the subject of predestination and reprobation, into which we cannot enter here. But we shall briefly summarize the leading points on which Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s have agreed and the points on which they differ.<br>First, that predestination exists, i.e. that God knows from eternity with infallible certainty who will be saved and that He wills from eternity to give them the graces by which salvation will be secured, is obvious from reason and is taught by Christ Himself (John 10:27), and by St. Paul (Romans 8:29, 30).<br>Second, while God has this infallible foreknowledge, we on our part cannot have an absolutely certain assurance that we are among the number of the predestined — unless indeed by means of a special Divine revelation such as we know from experience is rarely, if ever, given. This follows from the Tridentine condemnation of the teaching of the Reformers that we could and ought to believe with the certainty of faith in our own justification and election (Sess. VI, cap. ix, can. xiii-xv).<br>Third, the principal controverted point regarding predestination between Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s is concerned with its gratuity, and in order to understand the controversy it is necessary to distinguish between predestination in intention, i.e. as it is a mere act of knowledge and of purpose in the Divine mind, and in execution, i.e. as it means the actual bestowal of grace and of glory; and also between predestination in the adequate sense, as referring both to grace and to glory, and in the inadequate sense, as referring particularly to one's destination to glory, and abstracting from the grace by which glory is obtained. Now,<br>
<br>speaking of predestination in execution, all Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s maintain in opposition to Calvinists that it is not entirely gratuitous, but in the case of adults depends partly on the free mercy of God and partly on human cooperation; the actual bestowal of glory is at least partly a reward of true merit.
<br>Speaking of predestination in intention and in the adequate sense, Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s agree that it is gratuitous; so understood it includes the first grace which cannot be merited by man.
<br>But if we speak of predestination in intention and in the inadequate sense, i.e. to glory in abstraction from grace, there is no longer unanimity of opinion. Most Thomists and several other <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s maintain that predestination in this sense is gratuitous, i.e. God first destines a man to glory antecedently to any foreseen merits, and consequently upon this decrees to give the efficacious grace by which it is obtained. Predestination to grace is the result of an entirely gratuitous predestination to glory, and with this is combined for those not included in the decree of election what is known as a negative reprobation. Other <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s maintain on the contrary that there is no such thing as negative reprobation, and that predestination to glory is not gratuitous but dependent on foreseen merits. The order of dependence, according to these <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s, is the same in predestination in intention as it is in predestination in execution, and as already stated, the bestowal of glory only follows upon actual merit in the case of adults. These have been the two prevailing opinions followed for the most part in the schools, but a third opinion, which is a somewhat subtle via media, has been put forward by certain other <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s and defended with great skill by such an authority as Billot. The gist of this view is that while negative reprobation must be rejected, gratuitous election to glory ante praevisa merita must be retained, and an effort is made to prove that these two may be logically separated, a possibility overlooked by the advocates of the first two opinions. Without entering into details here, it is enough to observe that the success of this subtle expedient is very questionable.
<br>Fourth, as regards reprobation,<br>
<br>all Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s are agreed that God foresees from eternity and permits the final defection of some, but that the decree of His will destining them to eternal damnation is not antecedent to but consequent upon foreknowledge of their sin and their death in the state of sin. The first part of this proposition is a simple corollary from Divine omniscience and supremacy, and the second part is directed against Calvinistic and Jansenistic teaching, according to which God expressly created some for the purpose of punishing them, or at least that subsequently to the fall of Adam, He leaves them in the state of damnation for the sake of exhibiting His wrath. Catholic teaching on this point reechoes 2 Peter 3:9, according to which God does not wish that any should perish but that all should return to penance, and it is the teaching implied in Christ's own description of the sentence that is to be pronounced on the damned, condemnation being grounded not on the antecedent will of God, but on the actual demerits of men themselves (e.g. Matthew 25:41).
<br>So-called negative reprobation, which is commonly defended by those who maintain election to glory antecedently to foreseen merits, means that simultaneously with the predestination of the elect God either positively excludes the damned from the decree of election to glory or at least fails to include them in it, without, however, destining them to positive punishment except consequently on their foreseen demerits. It is this last qualification that distinguishes the doctrine of negative reprobation from Calvinistic and Jansenistic teaching, leaving room, for instance, for a condition of perfect natural happiness for those dying with only original sin on their souls. But, notwithstanding this difference, the doctrine ought to be rejected, for it is opposed very plainly to the teaching of St. Paul regarding the universality of God's will to save all (1 Timothy 2:4), and from a rational point of view it is difficult to reconcile with a worthy concept of Divine justice.

But among them some are recognized as being of fundamental importance, and to these in particular is the term attributes applied and special notice devoted by <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s — though there is no rigid agreement as to the number or classification of such attributes. As good a classification as any other is that based on the analogy of entitative and operative perfections in creatures — the former qualifying nature or essence as such and abstracting from activity, the latter referring especially to the activity of the nature in question. Another distinction is often made between physical, and moral or ethical, attributes — the former of themselves abstracting from, while the latter directly express, moral perfection. But without labouring with the question of classification, it will suffice to notice separately those attributes of leading importance that have not been already explained. Nothing need be added to what has been said above concerning self-existence, infinity, unity, and simplicity (which belong to the entitative class); but eternity, immensity, and immutability (also of the entitative class), together with the active attributes, whether physical or moral, connected with the Divine intellect and will, call for some explanation here.<br><br>By saying that God is eternal we mean that in essence, life, and action He is altogether beyond temporal limits and relations. He has neither beginning, nor end, nor duration by way of sequence or succession of moments. There is no past or future for God — but only an eternal present. If we say that He was or that He acted, or that He will be or will act, we mean in strictness that He is or that He acts; and this truth is well expressed by Christ when He says (John 8:58 — A.V.): "Before Abraham was, I am." Eternity, therefore, as predicated of God, does not mean indefinite duration in time — a meaning in which the term is sometimes used in other connections — but it means the total exclusion of the finiteness which time implies. We are obliged to use negative language in describing it, but in itself eternity is a positive perfection, and as such may be best defined in the words of Boethius as being "interminabilis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio," i.e. possession in full entirety and perfection of life without beginning, end, or succession.<br>The eternity of God is a corollary from His self-existence and infinity. Time being a measure of finite existence, the infinite must transcend it. God, it is true, coexists with time, as He coexists with creatures, but He does not exist in time, so as to be subject to temporal relations: His self-existence is timeless. Yet the positive perfection expressed by duration as such, i.e. persistence and permanence of being, belongs to God and is truly predicated of Him, as when He is spoken of, for example, as "Him that is, and that was and that is to come" (Revelation 1:4); but the strictly temporal connotation of such predicates must always be corrected by recalling the true notion of eternity.<br><br>Space, like time, is one of the measures of the finite, and as by the attribute of eternity, we describe God's transcendence of all temporal limitations, so by the attribute of immensity we express His transcendent relation to space. There is this difference, however, to be noted between eternity and immensity, that the positive aspect of the latter is more easily realized by us, and is sometimes spoken of, under the name of omnipresence, or ubiquity, as if it were a distinct attribute. Divine immensity means on the one hand that God is necessarily present everywhere in space as the immanent cause and sustainer of creatures, and on the other hand that He transcends the limitations of actual and possible space, and cannot be circumscribed or measured or divided by any spatial relations. To say that God is immense is only another way of saying that He is both immanent and transcendent in the sense already explained. As some one has metaphorically and paradoxically expressed it, "God's centre is everywhere, His circumference nowhere."<br>That God is not subject to spatial limitations follows from His infinite simplicity; and that He is truly present in every place or thing — that He is omnipresent or ubiquitous — follows from the fact that He is the cause and ground of all reality. According to our finite manner of thinking we conceive this presence of God in things spatial as being primarily a presence of power and operation — immediate Divine efficiency being required to sustain created beings in existence and to enable them to act; but, as every kind of Divine action ad extra is really identical with the Divine nature or essence, it follows that God is really present everywhere in creation not merely per virtuten et operationem, but per essentiam. In other words God Himself, or the Divine nature, is in immediate contact with, or immanent in, every creature — conserving it in being and enabling it to act. But while insisting on this truth we must, if we would avoid contradiction, reject every form of the pantheistic hypothesis. While emphasizing Divine immanence we must not overlook Divine transcendence.<br>There is no lack of Scriptural or ecclesiastical testimonies asserting God's immensity and ubiquity. It is enough to refer for example to:<br><br>In God "there is no change, nor shadow of alteration" (James 1:17); "They [i.e. "the works of thy hands"] shall perish, but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment. And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the selfsame and thy years shall not fail" (Hebrews 1:10-12, Psalm 101:26-28. Cf. Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8). These are some of the Scriptural texts which clearly teach Divine immutability or unchangeableness, and this attribute is likewise emphasized in <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> teaching, as by the Council of Nicaea against the Arians, who attributed mutability to the Logos (Denzinger, 54-old No. 18), and by the Vatican Council in its famous definition.<br>That the Divine nature is essentially immutable, or incapable of any internal change, is an obvious corollary from Divine infinity. Changeableness implies the capacity for increase or diminution of perfection, that is, it implies finiteness and imperfection. But God is infinitely perfect and is necessarily what He is. It is true that some attributes by which certain aspects of Divine perfection are described are hypothetical or relative, in the sense that they presuppose the contingent fact of creation: omnipresence, for example, presupposes the actual existence of spatial beings. But it is obvious that the mutability implied in this belongs to creatures, and not to the Creator; and it is a strange confusion of thought that has led some modern Theists — even professing Christians — to maintain that such attributes can be laid aside by God, and that the Logos in becoming incarnate actually did lay them aside, or at least ceased from their active exercise. But as creation itself did not affect the immutability of God, so neither did the incarnation of a Divine Person; whatever change was involved in either case took place solely in the created nature.<br><br>The so-called active Divine attributes are best treated in connection with the Divine Intellect and Will — principles of Divine operation ad extra — to which they are all ultimately reducible.<br><br>Description of the Divine Knowledge<br>That God is omniscient or possesses the most perfect knowledge of all things, follows from His infinite perfection. In the first place He knows and comprehends Himself fully and adequately, and in the next place He knows all created objects and comprehends their finite and contingent mode of being. Hence He knows them individually or singularly in their finite multiplicity, knows everything possible as well as actual; knows what is bad as well as what is good. Everything, in a word, which to our finite minds signifies perfection and completeness of knowledge may be predicated of Divine omniscience, and it is further to be observed that it is on Himself alone that God depends for His knowledge. To make Him in any way dependent on creatures for knowledge of created objects would destroy His infinite perfection and supremacy. Hence it is in His eternal, unchangeable, comprehensive knowledge of Himself or of His own infinite being that God knows creatures and their acts, whether there is question of what is actual or merely possible. Indeed, Divine knowledge itself is really identical with Divine essence, as are all the attributes and acts of God; but according to our finite modes of thought we feel the need of conceiving them distinctly and of representing the Divine essence as the medium or mirror in which the Divine intellect sees all truth. Moreover, although the act of Divine knowledge is infinitely simple in itself, we feel the need of further distinctions — not as regards the knowledge in itself, but as regards the multiplicity of finite objects which it embraces. Hence the universally recognized distinction between the knowledge of vision (scientia visionis) and that of simple intelligence (simplicis intelligentiae), and the famous controversy regarding the scientia media. We shall briefly explain this distinction and the chief difficulties involved in this controversy.<br>Distinctions in the Divine Knowledge<br>In classifying the objects of Divine omniscience the most obvious and fundamental distinction is between things that actually exist at any time, and those that are merely possible. And it is in reference to these two classes of objects that the distinction is made between knowledge "of vision" and "of simple intelligence"; the former referring to things actual, and the latter to the merely possible. This distinction might appear at first sight to be absolutely comprehensive and adequate to the purpose for which we introduce distinctions at all, but some difficulty is felt once the question is raised of God's knowledge of the acts of creatures endowed with free will. That God knows infallibly and from eternity what, for example, a certain man, in the exercise of free will, will do or actually does in any given circumstances, and what he might or would actually have done in different circumstances is beyond doubt — being a corollary from the eternal actuality of Divine knowledge. So to speak, God has not to wait on the contingent and temporal event of the man's free choice to know what the latter's action will be; He knows it from eternity. But the difficulty is: how, from our finite point of view, to interpret and explain the mysterious manner of God's knowledge of such events without at the same time sacrificing the free will of the creature.<br>The Dominican school has defended the view that the distinction between knowledge of "vision" and of "simple intelligence" is the only one we need or ought to employ in our effort to conceive and describe Divine omniscience, even in relation to the free acts of intelligent creatures. These acts, if they ever take place, are known or foreknown by God as if they were eternally actual — and this is admitted by all; otherwise they remain in the category of the merely possible — and this is what the Jesuit school denies, pointing for example to statements such as that of Christ regarding the people of Tyre and Sidon, who would have done penance had they received the same graces as the Jews (Matthew 11:21). This school therefore maintains that to the actual as such and the purely possible we must add another category of objects: hypothetical facts that may never become actual, but would become actual were certain conditions realized. The hypothetical truth of such facts, it is rightly contended, is more than mere possibility, yet less than actuality; and since God knows such facts in their hypothetical character there is good reason for introducing a distinction to cover them — and this is the scientia media. And it is clear that even acts that take place and as such fall finally under the knowledge of vision may be conceived as falling first under the knowledge of simple intelligence and then under the scientia media, the progressive formula would be:<br>
<br>first, it is possible Peter would do so and so;
<br>second, Peter would do so and so, given certain conditions;
<br>third, Peter will do or does so and so.
<br>Now, were it not for the differences that lie behind there would probably be no objection raised to scientia media, but the distinction itself is only the prelude to the real problem. Admitting that God knows from eternity the future free acts of creatures the question is how or in what way He knows them or rather how we are to conceive and explain by analogy the manner of the divine foreknowledge, which in itself is beyond our powers of comprehension? It is admitted that God knows them first as objects of the knowledge of simple intelligence; but does he know them also as objects of the scientia media, i.e. hypothetically and independently of any decree of His will, determining their actuality, or does He know them only in and through such decrees? The Dominican contention is that God's knowledge of future free acts depends on the decrees of His free will which predetermine their actuality by means of the praemotio physica. God knows, for example, that Peter will do so and so, because He has decreed from eternity so to move Peter's free will that the latter will infallibly, although freely, cooperate with, or consent to, the Divine premotion. In the case of good acts there is a physical and intrinsic connection between the motion given by God and the consent of Peter's will, while as regards morally bad acts, the immorality as such — which is a privation and not a positive entity — comes entirely from the created will.<br>The principal difficulties against this view are that in the first place it seems to do away with human free will, and in the next place to make God responsible for sin. Both consequences of course are denied by those who uphold it, but, making all due allowance for the mystery which shrouds the subject, it is difficult to see how the denial of free will is not logically involved in the theory of the praemotio physica, how the will can be said to consent freely to a motion which is conceived as predetermining consent; such explanations as are offered merely amount to the assertion that, after all, the human will is free. The other difficulty consists in the twofold fact that God is represented as giving the praemotio physica in the natural order for the act of will by which the sinner embraces evil, and that He withholds the supernatural praemotio or efficacious grace which is essentially required for the performance of a salutary act. The Jesuit school, on the other hand — with whom probably a majority of independent <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s agree — using the scientia media maintains that we ought to conceive God's knowledge of future free acts not as being dependent and consequent upon decrees of His will, but in its character as hypothetical knowledge or being antecedent to them. God knows in the scientia media what Peter would do if in given circumstances he were to receive a certain aid, and this before any absolute decree to give that aid is supposed. Thus there is no predetermination by the Divine of what the human will freely chooses; it is not because God foreknows (having foredecreed) a certain free act that that act takes place, but God foreknows it in the first instance because as a matter of fact it is going to take place; He knows it as a hypothetical objective fact before it becomes an object of the scientia visionis — or rather this is how, in order to safeguard human liberty, we must conceive Him as knowing it. It was thus, for example, that Christ knew what would have been the results of His ministry among the people of Tyre and Sidon. But one must be careful to avoid implying that God's knowledge is in any way dependent on creatures, as if He had, so to speak, to await the actual event in time before knowing infallibly what a free creature may choose to do. From eternity He knows, but does not predetermine the creature's choice. And if it be asked how we can conceive this knowledge to exist antecedently to and independently of some act of the Divine will, on which all things contingent depend, we can only say that the objective truth expressed by the hypothetical facts in question is somehow reflected in the Divine Essence, which is the mirror of all truth, and that in knowing Himself God knows these things also. Whichever way we turn we are bound ultimately to encounter a mystery, and, when there is a question of choosing between a theory which refers the mystery to God Himself and one which only saves the truth of human freedom by making free-will itself a mystery, most <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s naturally prefer the former alternative.<br><br>Description of the Divine Will<br>(a) The highest perfections of creatures are reducible to functions of intellect and will, and, as these perfections are realized analogically in God, we naturally pass from considering Divine knowledge or intelligence to the study of Divine volition. The object of intellect as such is the true; the object of will as such, the good. In the case of God it is evident that His own infinite goodness is the primary and necessary object of His will, created goodness being but a secondary and contingent object. This is what the inspired writer means when he says: "The Lord hath made all things for himself" (Proverbs 16:4). The Divine will of course, like the Divine intellect, is really identical with the Divine Essence but according to our finite modes of thought we are obliged to speak of them as if they were distinct and, just as the Divine intellect cannot be dependent on created objects for its knowledge of them, neither can the Divine will be so dependent for its volition. Had no creature ever been created, God would have been the same self-sufficient being that He is, the Divine will as an appetitive faculty being satisfied with the infinite goodness of the Divine Essence itself. This is what the Vatican Council means by speaking of God as "most happy in and by Himself" — not that He does not truly wish and love the goodness of creatures, which is a participation of His own, but that He has no need of creatures and is in no way dependent on them for His bliss.<br>(b) Hence it follows that God possesses the perfection of free will in an infinitely eminent degree. That is to say, without any change in Himself or in His eternal act of volition, He freely chooses whether or not creatures shall exist and what manner of existence shall be theirs, and this choice or determination is an exercise of that dominion which free will (liberty of indifference) essentially expresses. In itself free will is an absolute and positive perfection, and as such is most fully realized in God. Yet we are obliged to describe Divine liberty as we have done relatively to its effects in creation, and, by way of negation, we must exclude the imperfections associated with free will in creatures. These imperfections may be reduced to two:<br>
<br>potentiality and mutability as opposed to immutable pure act, and
<br>the power of choosing what is evil.
<br>Only the second need be noticed here.<br>(c) When a free creature chooses what is evil, he does not choose it formally as such, but only sub specie boni, i.e., what his will really embraces is some aspect of goodness which he truly or falsely believes to be discoverable in the evil act. Moral evil ultimately consists in choosing some such fancied good which is known more or less clearly to be opposed to the Supreme Good, and it is obvious that only a finite being can be capable of such a choice. God necessarily loves Himself, who is the Supreme Good, and cannot wish anything that would be opposed to Himself. Yet He permits the sins of creatures, and it has always been considered one of the gravest problems of theism to explain why this is so. We cannot enter on the Problem here, but must content ourselves with a few brief observations.<br>
<br>First, however difficult or even mysterious, may be the problem of moral evil for the theist, it is many times more difficult for every kind of anti-theist.
<br>Secondly, so far as we can judge the possibility of moral defection seems to be a natural limitation of created free will, and can only be excluded supernaturally, and, even viewing the question from a purely rational standpoint, we are conscious on the whole that, whatever the final solution may be, it is better that God should have created free beings capable of sinning than that He should not have created free beings at all. Few men would resign the faculty of free will just to escape the danger of abusing it.
<br>Thirdly, some final solution, not at present apparent to our limited intelligence, may be expected on merely rational grounds from the infinite wisdom and justice of God, and supernatural revelation, which gives us glimpses of the Divine plan, goes a long way towards supplying a complete answer to the questions that most intimately concern us. The clearly perceived truth to be emphasized here is that sin is hateful to God and essentially opposed to His infinite holiness, and that the wilful discord which sin introduces into the harmony of the universe will somehow be set right in the end.
<br>There is no need to delay in discussing mere physical as distinct from moral evil, and it is enough to remark that such evil is not merely permitted, but willed by God, not indeed in its character as evil, but as being, in such a universe as the present, a means towards good and in itself relatively good.<br>Distinctions in the Divine Will<br>As distinctions are made in the Divine knowledge, so also in the Divine will, and one of these latter is of sufficient importance to deserve a passing notice here. This is the distinction between the antecedent and consequent will, and its principal application is to the question of man's salvation. God, according to St. Paul (1 Timothy 2:4),"wills that all men be saved", and this is explained to be an antecedent will; that is to say, abstracting from circumstances and conditions which may interfere with the fulfilment of God's will (e.g., sin on man's part, natural order in the universe, etc.), He has a sincere wish that all men should attain supernatural salvation, and this will is so far efficacious that He provides and intends the necessary means of salvation for all — sufficient actual graces for those who are capable of cooperating with them and the Sacrament of Baptism for infants. On the other hand, the consequent will takes account of those circumstances and conditions and has reference to what God wills and executes in consequence of them. It is thus, for example, that He condemns the wicked to punishment after death and excludes unbaptized infants from the beatific vision.<br><br>Several attributes and several aspects of Divine activity partake both of an intellectual and a volitional character and must be treated from the combined point of view. Such are omnipotence, holiness, justice, blessedness, and so forth, but it is unnecessary to delay on such attributes which are self-explanatory. Some notice, on the other hand, must be devoted to providence and to the particular aspects of providence which we call predestination and reprobation; and with a brief treatment of these which are elsewhere fully treated this article will be concluded.<br>Providence<br>Providence may be defined as the scheme in the Divine mind by which all things treated are ordered and guided efficiently to a common end or purpose (ratio perductionis rerum in finem in mente divina existens). It includes an act of intellect and an act of will, in other words knowledge and power. And that there is such a thing as Divine Providence by which the entire universe is ruled clearly follows from the fact that God is the author of all things and that order and purpose must characterize the action of an intelligent creator. Nor is any truth more insistently proclaimed in revelation. What the author of Wisdom (xiv, 3) says of a particular thing is applicable to the universe as a whole: "But your providence, O Father, governs it", and no more beautiful illustration of the same truth has ever been given than that given by Christ Himself when He instances God's care for the birds of the air and the lilies of the field (Matthew 6:25 sq.). But to rational creatures God's providential care is extended in a very special way, yet not so as to do away with the utility and efficacy of prayer, whether for temporal or spiritual favours (Matthew 7:8), nor to disturb or override the efficiency of secondary causes. It is in and through secondary causes that providence ordinarily works, and no miracle, as a rule, is to be expected in answer to prayer<br>Predestination and reprobation<br>Predestination and reprobation are those special parts of Divine Providence which deal specially with man's salvation or damnation in the present supernatural order. Predestination is the foreknowledge on the part of God of those who will de facto be saved and the preparation and bestowal of the means by which salvation is obtained, while reprobation is the foreknowledge of those who will de facto be damned and the permission of this eventuality by God. In both cases an act of the intellect (infallible foreknowledge), and an act of the will are supposed; but whereas in predestination the antecedent and consequent will is the same, in reprobation God wills consequently what He does not antecedently will at all but only permits, namely, the eternal punishment of the sinner.<br>Many controversies have arisen on the subject of predestination and reprobation, into which we cannot enter here. But we shall briefly summarize the leading points on which Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s have agreed and the points on which they differ.<br>First, that predestination exists, i.e. that God knows from eternity with infallible certainty who will be saved and that He wills from eternity to give them the graces by which salvation will be secured, is obvious from reason and is taught by Christ Himself (John 10:27), and by St. Paul (Romans 8:29, 30).<br>Second, while God has this infallible foreknowledge, we on our part cannot have an absolutely certain assurance that we are among the number of the predestined — unless indeed by means of a special Divine revelation such as we know from experience is rarely, if ever, given. This follows from the Tridentine condemnation of the teaching of the Reformers that we could and ought to believe with the certainty of faith in our own justification and election (Sess. VI, cap. ix, can. xiii-xv).<br>Third, the principal controverted point regarding predestination between Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s is concerned with its gratuity, and in order to understand the controversy it is necessary to distinguish between predestination in intention, i.e. as it is a mere act of knowledge and of purpose in the Divine mind, and in execution, i.e. as it means the actual bestowal of grace and of glory; and also between predestination in the adequate sense, as referring both to grace and to glory, and in the inadequate sense, as referring particularly to one's destination to glory, and abstracting from the grace by which glory is obtained. Now,<br>
<br>speaking of predestination in execution, all Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s maintain in opposition to Calvinists that it is not entirely gratuitous, but in the case of adults depends partly on the free mercy of God and partly on human cooperation; the actual bestowal of glory is at least partly a reward of true merit.
<br>Speaking of predestination in intention and in the adequate sense, Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s agree that it is gratuitous; so understood it includes the first grace which cannot be merited by man.
<br>But if we speak of predestination in intention and in the inadequate sense, i.e. to glory in abstraction from grace, there is no longer unanimity of opinion. Most Thomists and several other <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s maintain that predestination in this sense is gratuitous, i.e. God first destines a man to glory antecedently to any foreseen merits, and consequently upon this decrees to give the efficacious grace by which it is obtained. Predestination to grace is the result of an entirely gratuitous predestination to glory, and with this is combined for those not included in the decree of election what is known as a negative reprobation. Other <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s maintain on the contrary that there is no such thing as negative reprobation, and that predestination to glory is not gratuitous but dependent on foreseen merits. The order of dependence, according to these <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s, is the same in predestination in intention as it is in predestination in execution, and as already stated, the bestowal of glory only follows upon actual merit in the case of adults. These have been the two prevailing opinions followed for the most part in the schools, but a third opinion, which is a somewhat subtle via media, has been put forward by certain other <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s and defended with great skill by such an authority as Billot. The gist of this view is that while negative reprobation must be rejected, gratuitous election to glory ante praevisa merita must be retained, and an effort is made to prove that these two may be logically separated, a possibility overlooked by the advocates of the first two opinions. Without entering into details here, it is enough to observe that the success of this subtle expedient is very questionable.
<br>Fourth, as regards reprobation,<br>
<br>all Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s are agreed that God foresees from eternity and permits the final defection of some, but that the decree of His will destining them to eternal damnation is not antecedent to but consequent upon foreknowledge of their sin and their death in the state of sin. The first part of this proposition is a simple corollary from Divine omniscience and supremacy, and the second part is directed against Calvinistic and Jansenistic teaching, according to which God expressly created some for the purpose of punishing them, or at least that subsequently to the fall of Adam, He leaves them in the state of damnation for the sake of exhibiting His wrath. Catholic teaching on this point reechoes 2 Peter 3:9, according to which God does not wish that any should perish but that all should return to penance, and it is the teaching implied in Christ's own description of the sentence that is to be pronounced on the damned, condemnation being grounded not on the antecedent will of God, but on the actual demerits of men themselves (e.g. Matthew 25:41).
<br>So-called negative reprobation, which is commonly defended by those who maintain election to glory antecedently to foreseen merits, means that simultaneously with the predestination of the elect God either positively excludes the damned from the decree of election to glory or at least fails to include them in it, without, however, destining them to positive punishment except consequently on their foreseen demerits. It is this last qualification that distinguishes the doctrine of negative reprobation from Calvinistic and Jansenistic teaching, leaving room, for instance, for a condition of perfect natural happiness for those dying with only original sin on their souls. But, notwithstanding this difference, the doctrine ought to be rejected, for it is opposed very plainly to the teaching of St. Paul regarding the universality of God's will to save all (1 Timothy 2:4), and from a rational point of view it is difficult to reconcile with a worthy concept of Divine justice.

 <br>The Incarnation is the mystery and the dogma of the Word made Flesh. ln this technical sense the word incarnation was adopted, during the twelfth century, from the Norman-French, which in turn had taken the word over from the Latin incarnatio. The Latin Fathers, from the fourth century, make common use of the word; so Saints Jerome, Ambrose, Hilary, etc. The Latin incarnatio (in: caro, flesh) corresponds to the Greek sarkosis, or ensarkosis, which words depend on John (1:14) kai ho Logos sarx egeneto, "And the Word was made flesh". These two terms were in use by the Greek Fathers from the time of St. Irenæus--i.e. according to Harnack, A.D. 181-189 (cf. Irenaeus, "Adv. Haer." III, 19, n. i.; Migne, VII, 939). The verb sarkousthai, to be made flesh, occurs in the creed of the Council of Nicaea (cf. Denzinger, "Enchiridion", n. 86). In the language of Holy Writ, flesh means, by synecdoche, human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> or man (cf. Luke 3:6; Romans 3:20). Francisco Suárez deems the choice of the word incarnation to have been very apt. Man is called flesh to emphasize the weaker part of his <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. When the Word is said to have been incarnate, to have been made Flesh, the Divine goodness is better expressed whereby <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> "emptied Himself . . . and was found in outward bearing (schemati) like a man" (Philippians 2:7); He took upon Himself not only the <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of man, a <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> capable of suffering and sickness and death, He became like a man in all save only sin (cf. Francisco Suárez, "De Incarnatione", Praef. n. 5). The Fathers now and then use the word henanthropesis, the act of becoming man, to which correspond the terms inhumanatio, used by some Latin Fathers, and "Menschwerdung", current in German. The mystery of the Incarnation is expressed in Scripture by other terms: epilepsis, the act of taking on a <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> (Hebrews 2:16): epiphaneia, appearance (2 Timothy 1:10); phanerosis hen sarki, manifestation in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16); somatos katartismos, the fitting of a body, what some Latin Fathers call incorporatio (Hebrews 10:5); kenosis, the act of emptying one's self (Philippians 2:7). In this article, we shall treat of the fact, <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> and effects of the Incarnation.<br><br>The Incarnation implies three facts: (1) The Divine Person of Jesus Christ; (2) The Human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Jesus Christ; (3) The Hypostatic Union of the Human with the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> in the Divine Person of Jesus Christ.<br><br>We presuppose the historicity, of Jesus Christ — i.e. that He was a real person of history (cf. JESUS CHRIST); the Messiahship of Jesus; the historical worth and authenticity of the Gospels and Acts; the Divine ambassadorship of Jesus Christ established thereby; the establishment of an infallible and never failing teaching body to have and to keep the deposit of revealed truth entrusted to it by the Divine ambassador, Jesus Christ; the handing down of all this deposit by tradition and of part thereof by Holy Writ; the canon and inspiration of the <a data-href="Sacred Scripture" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Sacred Scripture/Sacred Scripture.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sacred Scripture</a>s--all these questions will be found treated in their proper places. Moreover, we assume that the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> and Divine personality are one and inseparable (see TRINITY). The aim of this article is to prove that the historical person, Jesus Christ, is really and truly <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, --i.e. has the <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, and is a Divine person. The Divinity of Jesus Christ is established by the Old Testament, by the New Testament and by tradition.<br><br>The Old Testament proofs of the Divinity of Jesus presuppose its testimony to Him as the Christ, the Messias (see MESSIAS). Assuming then, that Jesus is the Christ, the Messias promised in the Old Testament, from the terms of the promise it is certain that the One promised is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, is a Divine Person in the strictest sense of the word, the second Person of the Holy Trinity, the Son of the Father, One in <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Our argument is cumulative. The texts from the Old Testament have weight by themselves; taken together with their fulfilment in the New Testament, and with the testimony of Jesus and His apostles and His , they make up a cumulative argument in favour of the Divinity of Jesus Christ that is overwhelming in its force. The Old Testament proofs we draw from the Psalms, the Sapiential Books and the Prophets.<br>(a) TESTIMONY OF THE PSALMS<br>Psalm 2:7. "The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee." Here Jahweh, i.e., <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of Israel, speaks to the promised Messias. So St. Paul interprets the text (Hebrews 1:5) while proving the Divinity of Jesus from the Psalms. The objection is raised that St. Paul is here not interpreting but only accommodating Scripture. He applies the very same words of Psalm 2:7 to the <a data-href="priesthood" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/priesthood.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">priesthood</a> (Hebrews 5:5) and to the resurrection (Acts 13:33) of Jesus; but only in a figurative sense did the Father beget the Messias in the <a data-href="priesthood" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/priesthood.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">priesthood</a> and resurrection of Jesus; hence only in a figurative sense did He beget Jesus as His Son. We answer that St. Paul speaks figuratively and accommodates Scripture in the matter of the <a data-href="priesthood" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/priesthood.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">priesthood</a> and resurrection but not in the matter of the eternal generation of Jesus. The entire context of this chapter shows there is a question of real sonship and real Divinity of Jesus. In the same verse, St. Paul applies to Christ the words of Jahweh to David, the type of Christ: "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son". (2 Samuel 7:14) In the following verse, Christ is spoken of as the first-born of the Father, and as the object of the adoration of the angels; but only <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> is adored: "Thy throne, O <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, is forever and ever. . . Thy <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, O <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, hath anointed thee" (Psalm 44:7-8). St. Paul refers these words to Christ as to the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> (Hebrews 1:9). We follow the Massoretic reading, "Thy <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, O <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>". The Septuagint and New Testament reading, ho theos, ho theos sou, "O <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, Thy <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>", is capable of the same interpretation. Hence, the Christ is here called <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> twice; and his throne, or reign, is said to have been from eternity. Psalm 99:1: "The Lord said to my Lord (Heb., Jahweh said to my Adonai): Sit thou at my right hand". Christ cites this text to prove that He is Adonai (a Hebrew term used only for Deity), seated at the right hand of Jahweh, who is invariably the great <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of Israel (Matthew 22:44). In the same psalm, Jahweh says to Christ: "Before the day-star, I begat thee". Hence Christ is the begotten of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>; was begotten before the world was, and sits at the right hand of the heavenly Father. Other Messianic psalms might be cited to show the clear testimony of these inspired poems to the Divinity of the promised Messias.<br>(b) TESTIMONY OF THE SAPIENTIAL BOOKS<br>So clearly do these Sapiential Books describe uncreated Wisdom as a Divine Person distinct from the First Person, that rationalists have resort to a subterfuge and claim that the doctrine of uncreated Wisdom was taken over by the authors of these books from the Neo-Platonic philosophy of the Alexandrian school. It is to be noted that in the pre-sapiential books of the Old Testament, the uncreated Logos, or hrema, is the active and creative principle of Jahweh (see Psalm 32:4; 32:6; 118:89; 102:20; Isaiah 40:8; 55:11). Later the logos became sophia, the uncreated Word became uncreated Wisdom. To Wisdom were attributed all the works of creation and Divine Providence (see Job 28:12: Proverbs 8 and 9; Sirach 1:1; 24:5-12; Wisdom 6:21; 9:9). In Wis., ix, 1, 2, we have a remarkable instance of the attribution of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>'s activity to both the Logos and Wisdom. This identification of the pre-Mosaic Logos with the Sapiential Wisdom and the Johannine Logos (see LOGOS) is proof that the rationalistic subterfuge is not effective. The Sapiential Wisdom and the Johannine Logos are not an Alexandrian development of the Platonic idea, but are a Hebraistic development of the pre-Mosaic uncreated and creating Logos or Word.<br>Now for the Sapiential proofs: In Sirach 24:7, Wisdom is described as uncreated, the "first born of the Most High before all creatures", "from the beginning and before the World was I made" (Sirach 24:14). So universal was the identification of Wisdom with the Christ, that even the Arians concurred with the Fathers therein; and strove to prove by the word ektise, made or created, of verse 14, that incarnate Wisdom was created. The Fathers did not make answer that the word Wisdom was not to be understood of the Christ, but explained that the word ektise had here to be interpreted in keeping with other passages of Holy Writ and not according to its usual meaning,--that of the Septuagint version of Genesis 1:1. We do not know the original Hebrew or Aramaic word; it may have been the same word that occurs in Prov. viii, 22: "The Lord possessed me (Hebrew gat me by generation; see Genesis 4:1) in the beginning of His ways, before He made anything from the beginning, I was set up from eternity." Wisdom speaking of itself in the Book of Ecclesiasticus cannot contradict what Wisdom says of itself in Proverbs and elsewhere. Hence the Fathers were quite right in explaining ektise not to mean made or created in any strict sense of the terms (see St. Athanasius, "Sermo ii contra Arianos", n. 44; Migne, P.G., XXVI, 239). The Book of Wisdom, also, speaks clearly of Wisdom as "the worker of all things . . . a certain pure emanation of the glory of the almighty <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> . . . the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted mirror of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>'s majesty, and the image of his goodness." (Wisdom 7:21-26) St. Paul paraphrases this beautiful passage and refers it to Jesus Christ (Hebrews 1:3). It is clear, then, from the text-study of the books themselves, from the interpretation of these books by St. Paul, and especially, from the admitted interpretation of the Fathers and the liturgical uses of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>, that the personified wisdom of the Sapiential Books is the uncreated Wisdom, the incarnate Logos of St. John, the Word hypostatically united with human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>, Jesus Christ, the Son of the Eternal Father. The Sapiential Books prove that Jesus was really and truly <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>.<br>(c) TESTIMONY OF THE PROPHETIC BOOKS<br>The prophets clearly state that the Messias is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. Isaias says: "<a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> Himself will come and will save you" (35:4); "Make ready the way of Jahweh" (40:3); "Lo Adonai Jahweh will come with strength" (40:10). That Jahweh here is Jesus Christ is clear from the use of the passage by St. Mark (1:3). The great prophet of Israel gives the Christ a special and a new Divine name "His name will be called Emmanuel" (Isaiah 7:14). This new Divine name St. Matthew refers to as fulfilled in Jesus, and interprets to mean the Divinity of Jesus. "They shall call his name Emmanuel, which, being interpreted, is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> with us." (Matthew 1:23) Also in 9:6, Isaias calls the Messias <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>: "A child is born to us . . . his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> the Strong One, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace." Catholics explain that the very same child is called <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> the Strong One (9:6) and Emmanuel (7:14); the conception of the child is prophesied in the latter verse, the birth of the very same child is prophesied in the former verse. The name Emmanuel (<a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> with us) explains the name that we translate "<a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> the Strong One." It is uncritical and prejudiced on the part of the rationalists to go outside of Isaias and to seek in Ezekiel 32:21 the meaning "mightiest among heroes" for a word that everywhere else in Isaias is the name of "<a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> the Strong One" (see Isaiah 10:21). Theodotion translates literally theos ischyros; the Septuagint has "messenger". Our interpretation is that commonly received by Catholics and by Protestants of the stamp of Delitzsch ("Messianic Prophecies", p. 145). Isaias also calls the Messias the "sprout of Jahweh" (4:2), i.e. that which has sprung from Jahweh as the same in <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> with Him. The Messias is "<a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> our King" (Isaiah 52:7), "the Saviour sent by our <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Isaiah 52:10, where the word for Saviour is the abstract form of the word for Jesus); "Jahweh the <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of Israel" (Isaiah 52:12): "He that hath made thee, Jahweh of the hosts His name" (Isaiah 54:5)".<br>The other prophets are as clear as Isaias, though not so detailed, in their foretelling of the <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>ship of the Messias. To Jeremias, He is "Jahweh our Just One" (23:6 and 33:16). Micheas speaks of the twofold coming of the Child, His birth in time at Bethlehem and His procession in eternity from the Father (5:2). The Messianic value of this text is proved by its interpretation in Matthew (2:6). Zacharias makes Jahweh to speak of the Messias as "my Companion"; but a companion is on an equal footing with Jahweh (13:7). Malachias says: "Behold I send my angel, and he shall prepare the way before my face, and presently the Lord, whom you seek, and the angel of the testament, whom you desire, shall come to his temple" (3:1). The messenger spoken of here is certainly St. John the Baptist. The words of Malachias are interpreted of the Precursor by Our Lord Himself (Matthew 11:10). But the Baptist prepared the way before the face of Jesus Christ. Hence the Christ was the spokesman of the words of Malachias. But the words of Malachias are uttered by Jahweh the great <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of Israel. Hence the Christ or Messias and Jahweh are one and the same Divine Person. The argument is rendered even more forcible by the fact that not only is the speaker, Jahweh the <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of hosts, here one and the same with the Messias before Whose face the Baptist went: but the prophecy of the Lord's coming to the Temple applies to the Messias a name that is ever reserved for Jahweh alone. That name occurs seven times (Exodus 23:17; 34:23; Isaiah 1:24; 3:1; 10:16 and 33; 19:4) outside of Malachias, and is clear in its reference to the <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of Israel. The last of the prophets of Israel gives clear testimony that the Messias is the very <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of Israel Himself. This argument from the prophets in favour of the Divinity of the Messias is most convincing if received in the light of Christian revelation, in which light we present it. The cumulative force of the argument is well worked out in "Christ in Type and Prophecy", by Maas.<br><br>We shall give the witness of the Four Evangelists and of St. Paul. The argument from the New Testament has a cumulative weight that is overwhelming in its effectiveness, once the inspiration of the New Testament and the Divine ambassadorship of Jesus are proved (see INSPIRATION; CHRISTIANITY). The process of the Catholic apologetic and dogmatic upbuilding is logical and never-failing. The Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a> first establishes the teaching body to which Christ gave His deposit of revealed truth, to have and to keep and to hand down that deposit without error or failure. This teaching body gives us the Bible; and gives us the dogma of the Divinity of Christ in the unwritten and the written Word of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, i.e. in tradition and Scripture. When contrasted with the Protestant position upon "the Bible, the whole Bible and nothing but the Bible"--no, not even anything to tell us what is the Bible and what is not the Bible--the Catholic position upon the Christ-established, never-failing, never-erring teaching body is impregnable. The weakness of the Protestant position is evidenced in the matter of this very question of the Divinity of Jesus Christ. The Bible is the one and only rule of faith of Unitarians, who deny the Divinity of Jesus; of Modernistic Protestants, who make out His Divinity to be an evolution of His inner consciousness; of all other Protestants, be their thoughts of Christ whatsoever they may. The strength of the Catholic position will be clear to any one who has followed the trend of Modernism outside the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> and the suppression thereof within the pale.<br>WITNESS OF THE EVANGELISTS<br>We here assume the Gospels to be authentic, historical documents given to us by the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> as the inspired Word of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. We waive the question of the dependence of Matthew upon the Logia, the origin of Mark from "Q", the literary or other dependence of Luke upon Mark; all these questions are treated in their proper places and do not belong here in the process of Catholic apologetic and dogmatic theology. We here argue from the Four Gospels as from the inspired Word of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. The witness of the Gospels to the Divinity of Christ is varied in kind.<br>Jesus is the Divine Messias<br>The Evangelists, as we have seen, refer to the prophecies of the Divinity of the Messias as fulfilled in Jesus (see Matthew 1:23; 2:6; Mark 1:2; Luke 7:27).<br>Jesus is the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a><br>According to the testimony of the Evangelists, Jesus Himself bore witness to His Divine Sonship. As Divine Ambassador He can not have borne false witness. Firstly, He asked the disciples, at Caesarea Philippi, "Whom do men say that the Son of man is?" (Matthew 16:13). This name Son of man was commonly used by the Saviour in regard to Himself; it bore testimony to His human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> and oneness with us. The disciples made answer that others said He was one of the prophets. Christ pressed them. "But whom do you say that I am? "(ibid., 15). Peter, as spokesman, replied: "Thou art Christ, the Son of the living <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (ibid., 16). Jesus was satisfied with this answer; it set Him above all the prophets who were the adopted sons of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>; it made Him the natural Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. The adopted Divine sonship of all the prophets Peter had no need of special revelation to know. This natural Divine Sonship was made known to the leader of the Apostles only by a special revelation. "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven" (ibid., 17). Jesus clearly assumes this important title in the specially revealed and altogether new sense. He admits that He is the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> in the real sense of the word.<br>Secondly, we find that He allowed others to give Him this title and to show by the act of real adoration that they meant real Sonship. The possessed fell down and adored Him, and the unclean spirits cried out: "Thou art the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Mark 3:12). After the stilling of the storm at sea, His disciples adored Him and said: "Indeed thou art the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> "(Matthew 14:33). Nor did He suggest that they erred in that they gave Him the homage due to <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> alone. The centurion on Calvary (Matthew 27:54; Mark 15:39), the Evangelist St. Mark (i, 1), the hypothetical testimony of Satan (Matthew 4:3) and of the enemies of Christ (Matthew 27:40) all go to show that Jesus was called and esteemed the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. Jesus Himself clearly assumed the title. He constantly spoke of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> as "My Father" (Matthew 7:21; 10:32; 11:27; 15:13; 16:17, etc.).<br>Thirdly, the witness of Jesus to His Divine Sonship is clear enough in the Synoptics, as we see from the foregoing argument and shall see by the exegesis of other texts; but is perhaps even more evident in John. Jesus indirectly but clearly assumes the title when He says: "Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>? . . . the Father is in me and I in the Father." (John 10:36, 38) An even clearer witness is given in the narrative of the cure of the blind man in Jerusalem. Jesus said: "Dost thou believe in the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>?" He answered, and said: "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him? And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him." (John 9:35-38) Here as elsewhere, the act of adoration is allowed, and the implicit assent is in this wise given to the assertion of the Divine Sonship of Jesus.<br>Fourthly, likewise to His enemies, Jesus made undoubted profession of His Divine Sonship in the real and not the figurative sense of the word; and the Jews understood Him to say that He was really <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. His way of speaking had been somewhat esoteric. He spoke often in parables. He willed then, as He wills now, that faith be "the evidence of things that appear not" (Hebrews 11:1). The Jews tried to catch Him, to make Him speak openly. They met Him in the portico of Solomon and said: "How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly" (John 10:24). The answer of Jesus is typical. He puts them off for a while; and in the end tells them the tremendous truth: "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30). They take up stones to kill Him. He asks why. He makes them admit that they have understood Him aright. They answer: "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man makest thyself <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (ibid., 33). These same enemies had clear statement of the claim of Jesus on the last night that He spent on <a data-href="earth" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/earth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">earth</a>. Twice He appeared before the Sanhedrim, the highest authority of the enslaved Jewish nation. The first times the high priest, Caiphas, stood up and demanded: "I adjure thee by the living <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Matthew 26:63). Jesus had before held His peace. Now His mission calls for a reply. "Thou hast said it" (ibid., 64). The answer was likely--in Semitic fashion--a repetition of the question with a tone of affirmation rather than of interrogation. St. Matthew reports that answer in a way that might leave some doubt in our minds, had we not St. Mark's report of the very same answer. According to St. Mark, Jesus replies simply and clearly: "I am" (Mark 14:62). The context of St. Matthew clears up the difficulty as to the meaning of the reply of Jesus. The Jews understood Him to make Himself the equal of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. They probably laughed and jeered at His claim. He went on: 'Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, and coming in the clouds of heaven" (Matthew 26:64). Caiphas rent his garments and accused Jesus of blasphemy. All joined in condemning Him to death for the blasphemy whereof they accused Him. They clearly understood Him to make claim to be the real Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>; and He allowed them so to understand Him, and to put Him to death for this understanding and rejection of His claim. It were to blind one's self to evident truth to deny the force of this testimony in favour of the thesis that Jesus made claim to be the real Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. The second appearance of Jesus before the Sanhedrim was like to the first; a second time He was asked to say clearly: "Art thou then the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>?" He made reply: "You say that I am." They understood Him to lay claim to Divinity. "What need we any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth" (Luke 22:70, 71). This twofold witness is especially important, in that it is made before the great Sanhedrim, and in that it is the cause of the sentence of death. Before Pilate, the Jews put forward a mere pretext at first. "We have found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, and saying that he is Christ the king" (Luke 23:2). What was the result? Pilate found no cause of death in Him! The Jews seek another pretext. "He stirreth up the people . . . from Galilee to this place" (ibid., 5). This pretext fails. Pilate refers the case of sedition to Herod. Herod finds the charge of sedition not worth his serious consideration. Over and again the Jews come to the front with a new subterfuge. Over and again Pilate finds no cause in Him. At last the Jews give their real cause against Jesus. In that they said He made Himself a king and stirred up sedition and refused tribute to Caesar, they strove to make it out that he violated Roman law. Their real cause of complaint was not that Jesus violated Roman law; but that they branded Him as a violator of the Jewish law. How? "We have a law; and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> (John 19:7). The charge was most serious; it caused even the Roman governor "to fear the more." What law is here referred to? There can be no doubt. It is the dread law of Leviticus: "He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord dying let him die" (Leviticus 24:17). By virtue of this law, the Jews were often on the very point of stoning Jesus; by virtue of this law, they often took Him to task for blasphemy whensoever He made Himself the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>; by virtue of this same law, they now call for His death. It is simply out of the question that these Jews had any intention of accusing Jesus of the assumption of that adopted sonship of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> which every Jew had by blood and every prophet had had by special free gift of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>'s grace.<br>Fifthly, we may only give a summary of the other uses of thee title Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> in regard to Jesus. The angel Gabriel proclaims to Mary that her son will "be called the Son of the most High" (Luke 1:32); "the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Luke 1:35); St. John speaks of Him as "the only begotten of the Father" (John 1:14); at the Baptism of Jesus and at His Transfiguration, a voice from heaven cries: "This is my beloved son" (Matthew 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke 3:22; Matthew 17:3); St. John gives it as his very set purpose, in his Gospel, "that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (John 20:31).<br>Sixthly, in the testimony of John, Jesus identifies Himself absolutely with the Divine Father. According to John, Jesus says: "he that seeth me seeth the Father" (ibid., xiv, 9). St. Athanasius links this clear testimony to the other witness of John "I and the Father are one" (ibid., x, 30); and thereby establishes the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son. St. John Chrysostom interprets the text in the same sense. A last proof from John is in the words that bring his first Epistle to a close: "We know that the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> is come: and He hath given us understanding that we may know the true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, and may be in his true Son. This is the true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and life eternal" (1 John 5:20). No one denies that "the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" who is come is Jesus Christ. This Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> is the "true Son" of "the true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>"; in fact, this true son of the True <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, i.e. Jesus, is the true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and is life eternal. Such is the exegesis of this text given by all the Fathers that have interpreted it (see Corluy, "Spicilegium Dogmatico-Biblicum", ed. Gandavi, 1884, II, 48). All the Fathers that have either interpreted or cited this text, refer outos to Jesus, and interpret "Jesus is the true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and life eternal." The objection is raised that the phrase "true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (ho alethisnos theos) always refers, in John, to the Father. Yes, the phrase is consecrated to the Father, and is here used precisely on that account, to show that the Father who is, in this very verse, first called "the true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>", is one with the Son Who is second called "the true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" in the very same verse. This interpretation is carried out by the grammatical analysis of the phrase; the pronoun this (outos) refers of necessity to the noun near by, i.e. His true Son Jesus Christ. Moreover, the Father is never called "life eternal" by John; whereas the term is often given by him to the Son (John 11:25; 14:6: 1 John 1:2; 5:11-12). These citations prove beyond a doubt that the Evangelists bear witness to the real and natural Divine Sonship of Jesus Christ.<br>Outside the Catholic <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>, it is today the mode to try to explain away all these uses of the phrase Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, as if, forsooth, they meant not the Divine Sonship of Jesus, but presumably His sonship by adoption--a sonship due either to His belonging to the Jewish race or derived from His Messiahship. Against both explanations stand our arguments; against the latter explanation stands the fact that nowhere in the Old Testament is the term Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> given as a name peculiar to the Messias. The advanced Protestants of this twentieth century are not satisfied with this latter and wornout attempt to explain away the assumed title Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. To them it means only that Jesus was a Jew (a fact that is now denied by Paul Haupt). We now have to face the strange anomaly of ministers of Christianity who deny that Jesus was Christ. Formerly it was considered bold in the Unitarian to call himself a Christian and to deny the Divinity of Jesus; now "ministers of the Gospel" are found to deny that Jesus is the Christ, the Messias (see articles in the Hibbert Journal for 1909, by Reverend Mr. Roberts, also the articles collected under the title "Jesus or Christ?" Boston, 19m). Within the pale of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>, too, there were not wanting some who followed the trend of Modernism to such an extent as to admit that in certain passages, the term "Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" in its application to Jesus, presumably meant only adopted sonship of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. Against these writers was issued the condemnation of the proposition: "In all the texts of the Gospels, the name Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> is merely the equivalent of the name Messias, and does not in any wise mean that Christ is the true and natural Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (see decree "Lamentabili", S. Off., 3-4 July, 1907, proposition xxxii). This decree does not affirm even implicitly that every use of the name "Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" in the Gospels means true and natural Sonship of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. Catholic <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s generally defend the proposition whenever, in the Gospels, the name "Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" is used in the singular number, absolutely and without any additional explanation, as a proper name of Jesus, it invariably means true and natural Divine Sonship of Jesus Christ (see Billot, "De Verbo Incarnato," 1904, p. 529). Corluy, a very careful student of the original texts and of the versions of the Bible, declared that, whenever the title Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> is given to Jesus in the New Testament, this title has the inspired meaning of natural Divine Sonship; Jesus is by this title said to have the same <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> and substance as the Heavenly Father (see "Spicilegium", II, p. 42).<br>Jesus is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a><br>St. John affirms in plain words that Jesus is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. The set purpose of the aged disciple was to teach the Divinity of Jesus in the Gospel, Epistles, and Apocalypse that he has left us; he was aroused to action against the first heretics that bruised the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>. "They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us" (1 John 2:19). They did not confess Jesus Christ with that confession which they had obligation to make (1 John 4:3). John's Gospel gives us the clearest confession of the Divinity of Jesus. We may translate from the original text: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was in relation to <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and the Word was <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (John 1:1). The words ho theos (with the article) mean, in Johannine Greek, the Father. The expression pros ton theon reminds one forcibly of Aristotle's to pros ti einai. This Aristotelian way of expressing relation found its like in the Platonic, Neo-Platonic, and Alexandrian philosophy; and it was the influence of this Alexandrian philosophy in Ephesus and elsewhere that John set himself to combat. It was, then, quite natural that John adopted some of the phraseology of his enemies, and by the expression ho logos en pros ton theon gave forth the mystery of the relation of Father with Son: "the Word stood in relation to the Father", i.e., even in the beginning. At any rate the clause theos en ho logos means "the Word was <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>". This meaning is driven home, in the irresistible logic of St. John, by the following verse: "All things were made by him." The Word, then, is the Creator of all things and is true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. Who is the Word! It was made flesh and dwelt with us in the flesh (verse 14); and of this Word John the Baptist bore witness (verse 15). But certainly it was Jesus, according to John the Evangelist, Who dwelt with us in the flesh and to Whom the Baptist bore witness. Of Jesus the Baptist says: "This is he, of whom I said: After me there cometh a man, who is preferred before me: because he was before me" (verse 30). This testimony and other passages of St. John's Gospel are so clear that the modern rationalist takes refuge from their forcefulness in the assertion that the entire Gospel is a mystic contemplation and no fact-narrative at all (see GOSPEL OF SAINT JOHN). Catholics may not hold this opinion denying the historicity of John. The Holy Office, in the Decree "Lamentabili", condemned the following proposition: "The narrations of John are not properly speaking history but a mystic contemplation of the Gospel: the discourses contained in his Gospel are theological meditations on the mystery of salvation and are destitute of historical truth." (See prop. xvi.)<br>(b) WITNESS OF ST. PAUL<br>It is not the set purpose of St. Paul, outside of the Epistle to the Hebrews, to prove the Divinity of Jesus Christ. The great Apostle takes this fundamental principle of Christianity for granted. Yet so clear is the witness of Paul to this fact of Christ's Divinity, that the Rationalists and rationalistic Lutherans of Germany have strived to get away from the forcefulness of the witness of the Apostle by rejecting his form of Christianity as not conformable to the Christianity of Jesus. Hence they cry: "Los von Paulus, zurück zu Christus"; that is, "Away from Paul, back to Christ" (see Jülicher, Paulus und Christus", ed. Mohr, 1909). We assume the historicity of the Epistles of Paul; to a Catholic, the Christianity of St. Paul is one and the same with the Christianity of Christ. (See SAINT PAUL). To the Romans, Paul writes: "<a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin" (viii, 3). His Own Son (ton heautou) the Father sends, not a Son by adoption. The angels are by adoption the children of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>; they participate in the Father's <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> by the free gifts He has bestowed upon them. Not so the Own Son of the Father. As we have seen, He is more the offspring of the Father than are the angels. How more? In this that He is adored as the Father is adored; the angels are not adored. Such is Paul's argument in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Therefore, in St. Paul's theology, the Father's Own Son, Whom the angels adore, Who was begotten in the today of eternity, Who was sent by the Father, clearly existed before His appearance in the Flesh, and is, in point of fact, the great "I am who am",--the Jahweh Who spoke to Moses on Horeb. This identification of the Christ with Jahweh would seem to be indicated, when St. Paul speaks of Christ as ho on epi panton theos, "who is over all things, <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> blessed for ever" (Romans 9:5). This interpretation and punctuation are sanctioned by all the Fathers that have used the text; all refer to Christ the words "He who is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> over all". Petavius (De Trin., 11, 9, n. 2) cites fifteen, among whom are Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, Augustine, and Hilary. The Peshitta has the same translation as we have given. Alford, Trench, Westcott and Hort, and most Protestants are at one with us in this interpretation.<br>This identification of the Christ with Jahweh is clearer in the First Epistle to the Corinthians. Christ is said to have been Jahweh of the Exodus. "And all drank the same spiritual drink; (and they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ)" (x, 4). It was Christ Whom some of the Israelites "tempted, and (they) perished by the serpents" (x, 10); it was Christ against Whom "some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer" (x, 11). St. Paul takes over the Septuagint translation of Jahweh ho kyrios, and makes this title distinctive of Jesus. The Colossians are threatened with the deception of philosophy (ii, 8). St. Paul reminds them that they should think according to Christ; "for in him dwelleth the fulness of the <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>head (pleroma tes theotetos) corporeally" (ii, 9); nor should they go so low as give to angels, that they see not, the adoration that is due only to Christ (ii, 18, 19). "For in Him were all things created in heaven and on <a data-href="earth" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/earth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">earth</a>, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominations or principalities or powers; all things were created by Him and for Him" (eis auton). He is the cause and the end of all things, even of the angels whom the Colossians are so misguided as to prefer to Him (i, 16). The cultured Macedonians of Philippi are taught that in "the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on <a data-href="earth" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/earth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">earth</a>, and under the <a data-href="earth" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/earth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">earth</a>; and that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> the Father" (ii, 10, 11). This is the very same genuflexion and confession that the Romans are bidden to make to the Lord and the Jews to Jahweh (see Romans 14:6; Isaiah 14:24). The testimony of St. Paul could be given at much greater length. These texts are only the chief among many others that bear Paul's witness to the Divinity of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The two main sources wherefrom we draw our information as to tradition, or the unwritten Word of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, are the Fathers of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> and the general councils.<br>(a) THE FATHERS OF THE <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a><br>The Fathers are practically unanimous in explicitly teaching the Divinity of Jesus Christ. The testimony of many has been given in our exegesis of the dogmatic texts that prove the Christ to be <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. It would take over-much space to cite the Fathers adequately. We shall confine ourselves to those of the Apostolic and apologetic ages. By joining these testimonies to those of the Evangelists and St. Paul, we can see clearly that the Holy Office was right in condemning these propositions of Modernism: "The Divinity of Christ is not proven by the Gospels but is a dogma that the Christian conscience has evolved from the notion of a Messiah. It may be taken for granted that the Christ Whom history shows us is much inferior to the Christ Who is the object of Faith" (see prop. xxvii and xxix of Decree "Lamentabili").<br>The Fathers Themselves<br>St. Clement of Rome (A.D. 93-95, according to Harnack), in his first epistle to the Corinthians, xvi, 2, speaks of "The Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the Might of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Funk, "Patres Apostolici", Tübingen ed., 1901, p. 118), and describes, by quoting Isaiah 3:1-12, the humiliation that was foretold and came to pass in the self-immolation of Jesus. As the writings of the Apostolic Fathers are very scant, and not at all apologetic but rather devotional and exhortive, we should not look in them for that clear and plain defence of the Divinity of Christ which is evidenced in the writings of the apologists and later Fathers.<br>The witness of St. Ignatius of Antioch (A.D. 110-117, according to Harnack) is almost that of the apologetic age, in whose spirit he seems to have written to the Ephesians. It may well be that at Ephesus the very same heresies were now doing havoc which about ten years before or, according to Harnack's chronology, at the very same time, St. John had written his Gospel to undo. If this be so, we understand the bold confession of the Divinity of Jesus Christ which this grand confessor of the Faith brings into his greetings, at the beginning of his letter to the Ephesians. "Ignatius . . . . to the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> . . . which is at Ephesus . . . . in the will of the Father and of Jesus Christ Our <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> (tou theou hemon)." He says: "The Physician in One, of the Flesh and of the Spirit, begotten and not begotten, who was <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> in Flesh (en sarki genomenos theos) . . . Jesus Christ Our Lord" (c. vii; Funk, I, 218). "For Our <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> Jesus Christ was borne in the womb by Mary" (c. xviii, 2; Funk, I, 226). To the Romans he writes: "For Our <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> Jesus Christ, abiding in the Father, is manifest even the more" (c. iii, 3; Funk, 1, 256).<br>The witness of the Letter of Barnabas: "Lo, again, Jesus is not the Son of man but the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, made manifest in form in the Flesh. And since men were going to say that the Christ was the Son of David, David himself, fearing and understanding the malice of the wicked, made prophecy: The Lord said to my Lord . . . . . Lo, how David calls Him the Lord and not son" (c. xiii; Funk, I, 77).<br>In the apologetic age, Saint Justin Martyr (Harnack. A.D. 150) wrote: "Since the Word is the first-born of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, He is also <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Apol. I, n. 63; P.G., VI, 423). It is evident from the context that Justin means Jesus Christ by the Word; he had just said that Jesus was the Word before He became Man, and used to appear in the form of fire or of some other incorporeal image. St. Irenæus proves that Jesus Christ is rightly called the one and only <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and Lord, in that all things are said to have been made by Him (see "Adv. Haer.", III, viii, n. 3; P.G., VII, 868; bk. IV, 10, 14, 36). Deutero-Clement (Harnack, A.D. 166; Sanday, A.D. 150) insists: "Brethren, we should think of Jesus Christ as of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> Himself, as of the Judge of the living and the dead" (see Funk, I, 184). St. Clement of Alexandria (Sanday, A.D. 190) speaks of Christ as "true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> without any controversy, the equal of the Lord of the whole universe, since He is the Son and the Word is in <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Cohortatio ad Gentes, c. x; P.G., VIII, 227).<br>Pagan Writers<br>To the witness of these Fathers of the Apostolic and apologetic age, we add a few witnesses from the contemporary pagan writers. Pliny (A.D. 107) wrote to Trajan that the Christians were wont before the light of day to meet and to sing praises "to Christ as to <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Epist., x, 97). The Emperor Hadrian (A.D. 117) wrote to Servianus that many Egyptians had become Christians, and that converts to Christianity were "forced to adore Christ", since He was their <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> (see Saturninus, c. vii). Lucian scoffs at the Christians because they had been persuaded by Christ "to throw over the <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>s of the Greeks and to adore Him fastened to a cross" (De Morte Peregrini, 13). Here also may be mentioned the well-known graffito that caricatures the worship of the Crucified as <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. This important contribution to archaeology was found, in 1857, on a wall of the Paedagogium, an inner part of the Domus Gelotiana of the Palatine, and is now in the Kircher Museum, Rome. After the murder of Caligula (A.D. 41) this inner part of the Domus Gelotiana became a training-school for court pages, called the Paedagogium (see Lanciani, "Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome", ed. Boston, 1897, p. 186). This fact and the language of the graffito lead one to surmise that the page who mocked at the religion of one of his fellows has so become an important witness to the Christian adoration of Jesus as <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> in the first or, at the very latest, the second century. The graffito represents the Christ on a cross and mockingly gives Him an ass's head; a page is rudely scratched kneeling and with hands outstretched in the attitude of prayer; the inscription is "Alexamenos worships his <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Alexamenos sebetai ton theon). In the second century, too, Celsus arraigns the Christians precisely on this account that they think <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> was made man (see Origen, Against Celsus IV.14). Aristides wrote to the Emperor Antonius Pius (A.D. 138-161) what seems to have been an apology for the Faith of Christ: "He Himself is called the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>; and they teach of Him that He as <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> came down from heaven and took and put on Flesh of a Hebrew virgin" (see "Theol. Quartalschrift", Tübingen, 1892, p. 535).<br>(b) WITNESS OF THE COUNCILS<br>The first general council of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> was called to define the Divinity of Jesus Christ and to condemn Arius and his error (see ARIUS). Previous to this time, heretics had denied this great and fundamental dogma of the Faith; but the Fathers had been equal to the task of refuting the error and of stemming the tide of heresy. Now the tide of heresy was so strong as to have need of the authority of the universal <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> to withstand it. In his "Thalia", Arius taught that the Word was not eternal (en pote ote ouk en) nor generated of the Father, but made out of nothing (ex ouk onton hehonen ho logos); and though it was before the world was, yet it was a thing made, a created thing (poiema or ktisis). Against this bold heresy, the Council of Nicaea (325) defined the dogma of the Divinity: of Christ in the clearest terms: "We believe . . . in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, the Only-begotten, generated of the Father (hennethenta ek tou patros monogene), that is, of the substance of the Father, <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, Light of Light, True <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of True <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, begotten not made, the same in <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> with the Father (homoousion to patri) by Whom all things were made" (see Denzinger, 54).<br><br>The Gnostics taught that matter was of its very <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> evil, somewhat as the present-day Christian Scientists teach that it is an "error of mortal mind"; hence Christ as <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> could not have had a material body, and His body was only apparent. These heretics, called doketae included Basilides, Marcion, the Manichæans, and others. Valentinus and others admitted that Jesus had a body, but a something heavenly and ethereal; hence Jesus was not born of Mary, but His airy body passed through her virgin body. The Apollinarists admitted that Jesus had an ordinary body, but denied Him a human soul; the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> took the place of the rational mind. Against all these various forms of the heresy that denies Christ is true Man stand countless and clearest testimonies of the written and unwritten Word of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. The title that is characteristic of Jesus in the New Testament is Son of Man; it occurs some eighty times in the Gospels; it was His Own accustomed title for Himself. The phrase is Aramaic, and would seem to be an idiomatic way of saying "man". The life and death and resurrection of Christ would all be a lie were He not a man, and our Faith would be vain. (1 Corinthians 15:14). "For there is one <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, and one mediator of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and men, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5). Why, Christ even enumerates the parts of His Body. "See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have" (Luke 24:39). St. Augustine says, in this matter: "If the Body of Christ was a fancy, then Christ erred; and if Christ erred, then He is not the Truth. But Christ is the Truth; hence His Body was not a fancy' (QQ. lxxxiii, q. 14; P.L., XL, 14). In regard to the human soul of Christ, the Scripture is equally clear. Only a human soul could have been sad and troubled. Christ says: "My soul is sorrowful even unto death" (Matthew 26:38). "Now is my soul troubled" (John 12:27). His obedience to the heavenly Father and to Mary and Joseph supposes a human soul (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38; Luke 22:42). Finally Jesus was really born of Mary (Matthew 1:16), made of a woman (Galatians 4:4), after the angel had promised that He should be conceived of Mary (Luke 1:31); this woman is called the mother of Jesus (Matthew 1:18; 2:11; Luke 1:43; John 2:3); Christ is said to be really the seed of Abraham (Galatians 3:16), the son of David (Matthew 1:1), made of the seed of David according to the flesh (Romans 1:3), and the fruit of the loins of David (Acts 2:30). So clear is the testimony of Scripture to the perfect human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Jesus Christ, that the Fathers held it as a general principle that whatsoever the Word had not assumed was not healed, i.e., did not receive the effects of the Incarnation.<br><br>Here we consider this union as a fact; the <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of the union will be later taken up. Now it is our purpose to prove that the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> was really and truly united with the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Jesus, i.e., that one and the same Person, Jesus Christ, was <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and man. We speak here of no moral union, no union in a figurative sense of the word; but a union that is physical, a union of two substances or <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s so as to make One Person, a union which means that <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> is Man and Man is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> in the Person of Jesus Christ.<br><br>St. John says: "The Word was made flesh" (i, 14), that is, He Who was <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> in the Beginning (i, 2), and by Whom all things were created (i. 3), became Man. According to the testimony of St. Paul, the very same Person, Jesus Christ, "being in the form of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> [en morphe Theou hyparxon] . . . emptied himself, taking the form of a servant [morphen doulou labon]" (Philippians 2:6-7). It is always one and the same Person, Jesus Christ, Who is said to be <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and Man, or is given predicates that denote Divine and human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. The author of life (<a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>) is said to have been killed by the Jews (Acts 3:15); but He could not have been killed were He not Man.<br><br>The early forms of the creed all make profession of faith, not in one Jesus Who is the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and in another Jesus Who is Man and was crucified, but "in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, Who became Man for us and was crucified". The forms vary, but the substance of each creed invariably attributes to one and the same Jesus Christ the predicates of the <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>head and of man (see Denzinger, "Enchiridion"). Franzelin (thesis xvii) calls special attention to the fact that, long before the heresy of Nestorius, according to Epiphanius (Ancorat., II, 123, in P.G., XLII, 234), it was the custom of the Oriental <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> to propose to catechumens a creed that was very much more detailed than that proposed to the faithful; and in this creed the catechumens said: "We believe . . . in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, begotten of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> the Father . . . that is, of the substance of the Father . . . in Him Who for us men and for our salvation came down and was made Flesh, that is, was perfectly begotten of Mary ever Virgin by the Holy Spirit; Who became Man, that is, took perfect human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>, soul and body and mind and all whatsoever is human save only sin, without the seed of man; not in another man, but unto himself did He form Flesh into one holy unity [eis mian hagian henoteta]; not as He breathed and spoke and wrought in the prophets, but He became Man perfectly; for the Word was made Flesh, not in that It underwent a change nor in that It exchanged Its Divinity for humanity, but in that It united Its Flesh unto Its one holy totality and Divinity [eis mian . . . heautou hagian teleioteta te kai theoteta].' "The one holy totality", Franzelin considers, means personality, a person being an individual and complete subject of rational acts. This creed of the catechumens gives even the Divinity of the totality, i.e. the fact that the individual Person of Jesus is a Divine and not a human Person. Of this intricate question we shall speak later on.<br>The witness of tradition to the fact of the union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in the one Person of Jesus is clear not only from the symbols or creeds in use before the condemnation of Nestorius, but also from the words of the ante-Nicaean Fathers. We have already given the classic quotations from St. Ignatius the Martyr, St. Clement of Rome, St. Justin the Martyr, in all of which are attributed to the one Person, Jesus Christ, the actions or attributes of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and of Man. Melito, Bishop of Sardis (about 176), says: "Since the same (Christ) was at the same time <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and perfect Man, He made His two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s evident to us; His Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> by the miracles which He wrought during the three years after His baptism; His human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> by those thirty years that He first lived, during which the lowliness of the Flesh covered over and hid away all signs of the Divinity, though He was at one and the same time true and everlasting <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>" (Frag. vii in P.G., V, 1221). St. Irenæus, toward the close of the second century, argues: "If one person suffered and another Person remained incapable of suffering; if one person was born and another Person came down upon him that was born and thereafter left him, not one person but two are proven . . . whereas the Apostle knew one only Who was born and Who suffered" ("Adv. Haer.", III, xvi, n, 9, in P.G., VII, 928). Tertullian bears firm witness: "Was not <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> really crucified? Did He not really die as He really was crucified?" ("De Carne Christi", c. v, in P.L., II, 760).<br><br>We have treated the fact of the Incarnation, that is, the fact of the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Jesus, the fact of the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Jesus, the fact of the union of these two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in Jesus. We now take up the crucial question of the <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of this fact, the manner of this tremendous miracle, the way of uniting the Divine with the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> in one and the same Person. Arius had denied the fact of this union. No other heresy rent and tore the body of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> to any very great extent in the matter of this fact after the condemnation of Arius in the Council of Nicaea (325). Soon a new heresy arose in the explanation of the fact of the union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in Christ. Nicaea had, indeed, defined the fact of the union; it had not explicitly defined the <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of that fact; it had not said whether that union was moral or physical. The council had implicitly defined the union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in one hypostasis, a union called physical in opposition to the mere juxtaposition or joining of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s called a moral union. Nicaea had professed a belief in "One Lord Jesus Christ . . . true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of true <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> . . . Who took Flesh, became Man and suffered". This belief was in one Person Who was at the same time <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and Man, that is, had at the same time Divine and human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. Such teaching was an implicit definition of all that was later on denied by Nestorius. We shall find the great Athanasius, for fifty years the determined foe of the heresiarch, interpreting Nicaea's decree in just this sense; and Athanasius must have known the sense meant by Nicaea, in which he was the antagonist of the heretic Arius.<br><br>In spite of the efforts of Athanasius, Nestorius, who had been elected Patriarch of Constantinople (428), found a loophole to avoid the definition of Nicaea. Nestorius called the union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s a mysterious and an inseparable joining (symapheian), but would admit no unity (enosin) in the strict sense of the word to be the result of this joining (see "Serm.", ii, n. 4; xii, n. 2, in P.L., XLVIII). The union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s is not physical (physike) but moral, a mere juxtaposition in state of being (schetike); the Word indwells in Jesus like as <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> indwells in the just (loc. cit.); the indwelling of the Word in Jesus is, however, more excellent than the indwelling of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> in the just man by grace, for that the indwelling of the Word purposes the Redemption of all mankind and the most perfect manifestation of the Divine activity (Serm. vii, n. 24); as a consequence, Mary is the Mother of Christ (Christotokos), not the Mother of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> (Theotokos). As is usual in these Oriental heresies, the metaphysical refinement of Nestorius was faulty, and led him into a practical denial of the mystery that he had set himself to explain. During the discussion that Nestorius aroused, he strove to explain that his indwelling (enoikesis) theory was quite enough to keep him within the demands of Nicaea; he insisted that "the Man Jesus should be co-adored with the Divine union and almighty <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> [ton te theia symapheia to pantokratori theo symproskynoumenon anthropon] "(Serm., vii, n. 35); he forcibly denied that Christ was two persons, but proclaimed Him as one person (prosopon) made up of two substances. The oneness of the Person was however only moral, and not at all physical. Despite whatsoever Nestorius said as a pretext to save himself from the brand of heresy, he continually and explicitly denied the hypostatic union (enosin kath hypostasin, kata physin, kat ousian), that union of physical entities and of substances which the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> defends in Jesus; he affirmed a juxtaposition in authority, dignity, energy, relation, and state of being (synapheia kat authentian, axian, energeian, anaphoran, schesin); and he maintained that the Fathers of Nicaea had nowhere said that <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> was born of the Virgin Mary (Sermo, v, nn. 5 and 6).<br>Nestorius in this distortion of the sense of Nicaea clearly went against the tradition of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>. Before he had denied the hypostatic union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in Jesus, that union had been taught by the greatest Fathers of their time. St. Hippolytus (about 230) taught: "the Flesh [sarx] apart from the Logos had no hypostasis [oude . . . hypostanai edynato, was unable to act as principle of rational activity], for that its hypostasis was in the Word" ("Contra Noet.", n. 15, in P.G., X, 823). St. Epiphanius (about 365): "The Logos united body, mind, and soul into one totality and spiritual hypostasis" ("Haer.", xx, n. 4, in P.G., XLI, 277). "The Logos made the Flesh to subsist in the hypostasis of the Logos [eis heauton hypostesanta ten sarka]" ("Haer.", cxxvii, n. 29, in P.G., XLII, 684). St. Athanasius (about 350): "They err who say that it is one person who is the Son that suffered, and another person who did not suffer ...; the Flesh became <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>'s own by <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> [kata physin], not that it became consubstantial with the Divinity of the Logos as if coeternal therewith, but that it became <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>'s own Flesh by its very <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> [kata physin]." In this entire discourse ("Contra Apollinarium", I, 12, in P.G., XXVI, 1113), St. Athanasius directly attacks the specious pretexts of the Arians and the arguments that Nestorius later took up, and defends the union of two physical <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in Christ [kata physin], as opposed to the mere juxtaposition or joining of the same <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s [kata physin]. St. Cyril of Alexandria (about 415) makes use of this formula oftener even than the other Fathers; he calls Christ "the Word of the Father united in <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> with the Flesh [ton ek theou Patros Logon kata physin henothenta sarki] ("De Recta Fide", n. 8, in P.G., LXXVI, 1210). For other and very numerous citations, see Petavius (111, 4). The Fathers always explain that this physical union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s does not mean the intermingling of the <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s, nor any such union as would imply a change in <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, but only such union as was necessary to explain the fact that one Divine Person had human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> as His own true <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> together with His Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>.<br>The Council of Ephesus (431) condemned the heresy of Nestorius, and defined that Mary was mother in the flesh of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>'s Word made Flesh (can. i). It anathematized all who deny that the Word of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> the Father was united with the Flesh in one hypostasis (kath hypostasin); all who deny that there is only one Christ with Flesh that is His own; all who deny that the same Christ is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> at the same time and man (can. ii). In the remaining ten canons drawn up by St. Cyril of Alexandria, the anathema is aimed directly at Nestorius. "If in the one Christ anyone divides the substances, after they have been once united, and joins them together merely by a juxtaposition [mone symapton autas synapheia] of honour or of authority or of power and not rather by a union into a physical unity [synode te kath henosin physiken], let him be accursed" (can. iii). These twelve canons condemn piecemeal the various subterfuges of Nestorius. St. Cyril saw heresy lurking in phrases that seemed innocent enough to the unsuspecting. Even the co-adoration theory is condemned as an attempt to separate the Divine from the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> in Jesus by giving to each a separate hypostasis (see Denzinger, "Enchiridion", ed. 1908, nn. 113-26).<br><br>The condemnation of the heresy of Nestorius saved for the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> the dogma of the Incarnation, "the great mystery of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>liness" (1 Timothy 3:16), but lost to her a portion of her children, who, though dwindled down to insignificant numbers, still remain apart from her care. The union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in one Person was saved. The battle for the dogma was not yet won. Nestorius had postulated two persons in Jesus Christ. A new heresy soon began. It postulated only one Person in Jesus, and that the Divine Person. It went farther. It went too far. The new heresy defended only one <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>, as well as one Person in Jesus. The leader of this heresy was Eutyches. His followers were called Monophysites. They varied in their ways of explanation. Some thought the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s were intermingled into one. Others are said to have worked out some sort of a conversion of the human into the Divine. All were condemned by the Council of Chalcedon (451). This Fourth General Council of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> defined that Jesus Christ remained, after the Incarnation, "perfect in Divinity and perfect in humanity . . . consubstantial with the Father according to His Divinity, consubstantial with us according to His humanity . . . one and the same Christ, the Son, the Lord, the Only begotten, to be acknowledged in two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s not intermingled, not changed, not divisible, not separable" (see Denzinger, n. 148). By this condemnation of error and definition of truth, the dogma of the Incarnation was once again saved to the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>. Once again a large portion of the faithful of the Oriental <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> were lost to their mother. Monophysitism resulted in the national <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>es of Syria, Egypt, and Armenia. These national <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>es are still heretic, although there have in later times been formed Catholic rites called the Catholic Syriac, Coptic, and Armenian rites. The Catholic rites, as the Catholic Chaldaic rite, are less numerous than the heretic rites.<br><br>One would suppose that there was no more room for heresy in the explanation of the mystery of the <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of the Incarnation. There is always room for heresy in the matter of explanation of a mystery, if one does not hear the infallible teaching body to whom and to whom alone Christ entrusted His mysteries to have and to keep and to teach them till the end of time. Three patriarchs of the Oriental <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> gave rise, so far as we know, to the new heresy. These three heresiarchs were Sergius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Cyrus, the Patriarch of Alexandria, and Athanasius, the Patriarch of Antioch. St. Sophronius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, remained true and delated his fellow patriarchs to Pope Honorius. His successor in the see of Peter, St. Martin, bravely condemned the error of the three Oriental patriarchs, who admitted the decrees of Nicaea, Ephesus, and Chalcedon; defended the union of two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in one Divine Person; but denied that this Divine Person had two wills. Their principle was expressed by the words, en thelema kai mia energeia, by which they would seem to have meant one will and one activity, i.e. only one principle of action and of suffering in Jesus Christ and that one principle Divine. These heretics were called Monothelites. Their error was condemned by the Sixth General Council (the Third Council of Constantinople, 680). It defined that in Christ there were two natural wills and two natural activities, the Divine and the human, and that the human will was not at all contrary to the Divine, but rather perfectly subject thereto (Denzinger, n. 291). The Emperor Constans sent St. Martin into exile in Chersonesus. We have trace of only one body of Monothelites. The Maronites, about the monastery of John Maron, were converted from Monothelism in the time of the Crusades and have been true to the faith ever since. The other Monothelites seem to have been absorbed in Monophysitism, or in the schism of the Byzantine <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a> later one<br>The error of Monothelism is clear from the Scripture as well as from tradition. Christ did acts of adoration (John 4:22), humility (Matthew 11:29), reverence (Hebrews 5:7). These acts are those of a human will. The Monothelites denied that there was a human will in Christ. Jesus prayed: "Father, if Thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done," (Luke 22:42). Here there is question of two wills, the Father's and Christ's. The will of Christ was subject to the will of the Father. "As the Father hath given me commandment, so do I" (John 14:31). He became obedient even unto death (Philippians 2:8). The Divine will in Jesus could not have been subject to the will of the Father, with which will it was really identified.<br><br>Thus far we have that which is of Faith in this matter of the <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of the Incarnation. The human and Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s are united in one Divine Person so as to remain that exactly which they are, namely, Divine and human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s with distinct and perfect activities of their own. <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s go farther in their attempts to give some account of the mystery of the Incarnation, so as, at least, to show that there is therein no contradiction, nothing that right reason may not safely adhere to. This union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in one Person has been for centuries called a hypostatic union, that is, a union in the Divine Hypostasis. What is an hypostasis? The definition of Boethius is classic: rationalis naturae individua substantia (P.L., LXIV, 1343), a complete whole whose <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> is rational. This book is a complete whole; its <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> is not rational; it is not an hypostasis. An hypostasis is a complete rational individual. St. Thomas defines hypostasis as substantia cum ultimo complemento (III:2:3, ad 2um), a substance in its entirety. Hypostasis superadds to the notion of rational substance this idea of entirety; nor does the idea of rational <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> include this notion of entirety. Human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> is the principle of human activities; but only an hypostasis, a person, can exercise these activities. The Schoolmen discuss the question whether the hypostasis has anything more of reality than human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. To understand the discussion, one must needs be versed in scholastic Philosophy. Be the case as it may in the matter of human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> that is not united with the Divine, the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> that is hypostatically united with the Divine, that is, the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> that the Divine Hypostasis or Person assumes to Itself, has certainly more of reality united to it than the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Christ would have were it not hypostatically united in the Word. The Divine Logos identified with Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> (Hypostatic Union) means then that the Divine Hypostasis (or Person, or Word, or Logos) appropriates to Itself human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>, and takes in every respect the place of the human person. In this way, the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Christ, though not a human person, loses nothing of the perfection of the perfect man; for the Divine Person supplies the place of the human.<br>It is to be remembered that, when the Word took Flesh, there was no change in the Word; all the change was in the Flesh. At the moment of conception, in the womb of the Blessed Mother, through the forcefulness of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>'s activity, not only was the human soul of Christ created but the Word assumed the man that was conceived. When <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> created the world, the world was changed, that is, it passed from the state of nonentity to the state of existence; and there was no change in the Logos or Creative Word of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> the Father. Nor was there change in that Logos when it began to terminate the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. A new relation ensued, to be sure; but this new relation implied in the Logos no new reality, no real change; all new reality, all real change, was in the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. Anyone who wishes to go into this very intricate question of the manner of the Hypostatic Union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in the one Divine Personality, may with great profit read St. Thomas (III:4:2); Scotus (in III, Dist. i); (De Incarnatione, Disp. II, sec. 3); Gregory, of Valentia (in III, D. i, q. 4). Any modern text book on theology will give various opinions in regard to the way of the union of the Person assuming with the <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> assumed<br><br><br><br>Did union with the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> do away, with all bodily imperfections? The Monophysites were split up into two parties by this question. Catholics hold that, before the Resurrection, the Body of Christ was subject to all the bodily weaknesses to which human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> unassumed is universally subject; such are hunger, thirst, pain, death. Christ hungered (Matthew 4:2), thirsted (John 19:28), was fatigued (John 4:6), suffered pain and death. "We have not a high priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). "For in that, wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted, he is able to succour them also that are tempted" (Hebrews 2:18). All these bodily weaknesses were not miraculously brought about by Jesus; they were the natural results of the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> He assumed. To be sure, they might have been impeded and were freely willed by Christ. They were part of the free oblation that began with the moment of the Incarnation. "Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not; but a body thou hast fitted to me" (Hebrews 10:5). The Fathers deny that Christ assumed sickness. There is no mention in Scripture of any sickness of Jesus. Sickness is not a weakness that is a necessary belonging of human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. It is true that pretty much all mankind suffers sickness. It is not true that any specific sickness is suffered by all mankind. Not all men must needs have measles. No one definite sickness universally belongs to human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>; hence no one definite sickness was assumed by Christ. St. Athanasius gives the reason that it were unbecoming that He should heal others who was Himself not healed (P.G., XX, 133). Weaknesses due to old age are common to mankind. Had Christ lived to an old age, He would have suffered such weaknesses just as He suffered the weaknesses that are common to infancy. Death from old age would have come to Jesus, had He not been violently put to death (see St. Augustine, "De Peccat.", II, 29; P.L., XLIV, 180). The reasonableness of these bodily imperfections in Christ is clear from the fact that He assumed human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> so as to satisfy for that <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>'s sin. Now, to satisfy forthe sin of another is to accept the penalty of that sin. Hence it was fitting that Christ should take upon himself all those penalties of the sin of Adam that are common to man and becoming. or at least not unbecoming to the Hypostatic Union. (See Summa Theologica III:14 for other reasons.) As Christ did not take sickness upon Himself, so other imperfections, such as deformities, which are not common to mankind, were not His. St. Clement of Alexandria (The Pedagogue III.1), Tertullian (De Carne Christi, c. ix), and a few others taught that Christ was deformed. They misinterpreted the words of Isaias: "There is no beauty in him, nor comeliness; and we have seen him, and there was no sightliness" etc. (53:2). The words refer only to the suffering Christ. <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s now are unanimous in the view that Christ was noble in bearing and beautiful in form, such as a perfect man should be; for Christ was, by virtue of His incarnation, a perfect man (see Stentrup, "Christologia", theses lx, lxi).<br><br>(a) IN THE WILL<br>Sinlessness<br>The effect of the Incarnation on the human will of Christ was to leave it free in all things save only sin. It was absolutely impossible that any stain of sin should soil the soul of Christ. Neither sinful act of the will nor sinful habit of the soul were in keeping with the Hypostatic Union. The fact that Christ never sinned is an article of faith (see Council, Ephes., can. x, in Denzinger, 122, wherein the sinlessness of Christ is implicit in the definition that he did not offer Himself for Himself, but for us). This fact of Christ's sinlessness is evident from the Scripture. "There is no sin in Him" (1 John 3:5). Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us" i.e. a victim for sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). The impossibility of a sinful act by Christ is taught by all <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s, but variously explained. Günther defended an impossibility consequent solely upon the Divine provision that He would not sin (Vorschule, II, 441). This is no impossibility at all. Christ is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. It is absolutely impossible, antecedent to the Divine prevision, that <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> should allow His flesh to sin. If <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> allowed His flesh to sin, He might sin, that is, He might turn away from Himself; and it is absolutely impossible that <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> should turn from Himself, be untrue to His Divine attributes. The Scotists teach that this impossibility to sin, antecedent to <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>'s revision, is not due to the Hypostatic Union, but is like to the impossibility of the beatified to sin, and is due to a special Divine Providence (see Scotus, in III, d. xiii, Q. i). St. Thomas (III:15:1) and all Thomists, Francisco Suárez (d. xxxiii, 2), Vasquez (d. xi, c. iii), de Lugo (d. xxvi, 1, n. 4), and all <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s of the Society of Jesus teach the now almost universally admitted explanation that the absolute impossibility of a sinful act on the part of Christ was due to the hypostatic union of His human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> with the Divine.<br>Liberty<br>The will of Christ remained free after the Incarnation. This is an article of faith. The Scripture is most clear on this point. "When he had tasted, he would not drink" (Matthew 27:34). "I will; be thou made clean" (Matthew 8:3). The liberty of Christ was such that He merited. "He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross. For which cause <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> also hath exalted him" (Philippians 2:8). "Who having joy set before him, endured the cross" (Hebrews 12:2). That Christ was free in the matter of death, is the teaching of all Catholics; else He did not merit nor satisfy for us by His death. Just how to reconcile this liberty of Christ with the impossibility of His committing sin has ever been a crux for <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s. Some seventeen explanations are given (see Summa Theologica III:47:3, ad 3; Molina, "Concordia", d. liii, membr. 4).<br>(b) IN THE INTELLECT<br>The effects of the Hypostatic Union upon the knowledge of Christ will be treated in a SPECIAL ARTICLE.<br>(c) SANCTITY OF CHRIST<br>The Humanity of Christ was holy by a twofold sanctity: the grace of union and sanctifying grace. The grace of union, i.e. the Substantial and Hypostatic Union of the two <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>s in the Divine Word, is called the substantial sanctity of Christ. St. Augustine says: "Tunc ergo sanctificavit se in se, hoc est hominem se in Verbo se, quia unus est Christus, Verbum et homo, sanctificans hominem in Verbo" (When the Word was made Flesh then, indeed, He sanctified Himself in Himself, that is, Himself as Man in Himself as Word; for that Christ is One Person, both Word and Man, and renders His human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> holy in the holiness of the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>) (In Johan. tract. 108, n. 5, in P.L., XXXV, 1916). Besides this substantial sanctity of the grace of Hypostatic Union, there was in the soul of Christ, the accidental sanctity called sanctifying grace. This is the teaching of St. Augustine, St. Athanasius, St. John Chrysostom, St. Cyril of Alexandria, and of the Fathers generally. The Word was "full of grace" (John 1:14), and "of his fullness we all have received, and grace for grace" (John 1:16). The Word were not full of grace, if any grace were wanting in Him which would be a perfection fitting to His human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. All <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s teach that sanctifying grace is a perfection fitting the humanity of Christ. The mystical body of Christ is the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>, whereof Christ is the Head (Romans 12:4; 1 Corinthians 12:11; Ephesians 1:20; 4:4; Colossians 1:18, 2:10). It is especially in this sense that we say the grace of the Head flows through the channels of the sacraments of the <a data-href="Church" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Church.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Church</a>--through the veins of the body of Christ. <a data-href="theologian" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/The Church/Theologians/theologian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">theologian</a>s commonly teach that from the very beginning of His existence, He received the fullness of sanctifying grace and other <a data-href="Supernatural" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Supernatural/Supernatural.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Supernatural</a> gifts (except faith, hope, and the moral virtue of penance); nor did He ever increase in these gifts or this sanctifying grace. For so to increase would be to become more pleasing to the Divine Majesty; and this were impossible in Christ. Hence St. Luke meant (ii, 52) that Christ showed more and more day after day the effects of grace in His outward bearing.<br>(d) LIKES AND DISLIKES<br>The Hypostatic Union did not deprive the Human Soul of Christ of its human likes and dislikes. The affections of a man, the emotions of a man were His in so far as they were becoming to the grace of union, in so far as they were not out of order. St. Augustine well argues: "Human affections were not out of place in Him in Whom there was really and truly a human body and a human soul" (City of <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> XIV.9). We find that he was subject to anger against the blindness of heart of sinners (Mark 3:5); to fear (Mark 14:33); to sadness (Matthew 26:37): to the sensible affections of hope, of desire, and of joy. These likes and dislikes were under the complete will-control of Christ. The fomes peccati, the kindling-wood of sin--that is, those likes and dislikes that are not under full and absolute control of right reason and strong will-power--could not, as a matter of course, have been in Christ. He could not have been tempted by such likes and dislikes to sin. To have taken upon Himself this penalty of sin would not have been in keeping with the absolute and substantial holiness which is implied by the grace of union in the Logos.<br><br>One of the most important effects of the union of the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> and human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> in One Person is a mutual interchange of attributes, Divine and human, between <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> and man, the Communicatio Idiomatum. The <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>-Man is one Person, and to Him in the concrete may be applied the predicates that refer to the Divinity as well as those that refer to the Humanity of Christ. We may say <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> is man, was born, died, was buried. These predicates refer to the Person Whose <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> is human, as well as Divine; to the Person Who is man, as well as <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. We do not mean to say that <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, as <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, was born; but <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>, Who is man, was born. We may not predicate the abstract Divinity of the abstract humanity, nor the abstract Divinity of the concrete man, nor vice versa; nor the concrete <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> of the abstract humanity, nor vice versa. We predicate the concrete of the concrete: Jesus is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>; Jesus is man; the <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>-Man was sad; the Man-<a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a> was killed. Some ways of speaking should not be used, not that they may not be rightly explained, but that they may easily be misunderstood in an heretical sense.<br><br>The human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Christ, united hypostatically with the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>, is adored with the same worship as the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> (see ADORATION). We adore the Word when we adore Christ the Man; but the Word is <a data-href="God" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/God.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">God</a>. The human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Christ is not at all the reason of our adoration of Him; that reason is only the Divine <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. The entire term of our adoration is the Incarnate Word; the motive of the adoration is the Divinity of the Incarnate Word. The partial term of our adoration may be the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Christ: the motive of the adoration is the same as the motive of the adoration that reaches the entire term. Hence, the act of adoration of the Word Incarnate is the same absolute act of adoration that reaches the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a>. The Person of Christ is adored with the cult called latria. But the cult that is due to a person is due in like manner to the whole <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of that Person and to all its parts. Hence, since the human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> is the real and true <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> of Christ, that human <a data-href="nature" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">nature</a> and all its parts are the object of the cult called latria, i.e., adoration. We shall not here enter into the question of the adoration of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. <br><br><br>In this expression the innermost teaching of the Old Testament is summed up, but it should be noted that the word kingdom means ruling as well; thus it signifies not so much the actual kingdom as the sway of the king — cf. Daniel 4:28-29. The Greek basileia of the New Testament also has these two meanings — cf. Aristotle, "Pol.", II, xi, 10; II, xiv; IV, xiii, 10. We find the theocracy sketched in Exodus 19:6; in the establishment of the kingdom, 1 Samuel 8:7: "They have not rejected thee, but me, that I should not reign over them." Still more clearly is it indicated in the promise of the theocratic kingdom, 2 Samuel 7:14-16. It is God Who rules in the theocratic king and Who will avenge any neglect on his part. All through the Psalter this same thought is found (cf. Psalm 10:5); it is constantly insisted that God's throne is in heaven and that there is His kingdom; this may explain St. Matthew's preference for the expression "kingdom of heaven", as being more familiar to the Hebrews for whom he wrote. The Prophets dwell on the thought that God is the Supreme King and that by Him alone all kings rule; cf. Isaiah 37:16-20. And when the temporal monarchy has failed, this same thought of God's ultimate rule over His people is brought into clearer relief till it culminates in the grand prophecy of Daniel 7:13 sq., to which the thoughts of Christ's hearers must have turned when they heard Him speak of His kingdom. In that vision the power of ruling over all the forces of evil as symbolized by the four beasts which are the four kingdoms is given to "one like the son of man". At the same time we catch a glimpse in the apocryphal Psalms of Solomon of the way in which, side by side with the truth, there grew up among the carnal-minded the idea of a temporal sovereignty of the Messias, an idea, which was (Luke 19:11; Matthew 18:1; Acts 1:6) to exercise so baneful an influence on subsequent generations; cf. especially Ps. Sol., xvii, 23-28, where God is besought to raise up the King, the Son of David, to crush the nations and purify Jerusalem, etc. In the Greek Book of Wisdom, however, we find the most perfect realization of what was truly implied by this "rule" of God — "She (Wisdom) led the just man through direct paths and shewed him the kingdom of God", i.e. in what that kingdom consisted.<br><br><a class="internal-link" data-href="Anarchy.md" href="https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Natural/Anarchy.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Anarchy</a>]]></description><link>https://wiki.davidbaunach.com/The Web/Jesus Christ.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Web/Jesus Christ.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[techpriest_baunach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 03:00:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[index]]></title><description><![CDATA[
